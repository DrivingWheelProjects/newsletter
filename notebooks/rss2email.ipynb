The NFL wants to gain deeper insight from the location-tracking data that wearable sensors measure for each player on the field, at a rate of 10 frames per second (in the Kaggle competition data set).</p>\", \"paragraphs\":[{\"p\":\"<p>The BDB competition has one data set and two tracks. The data set is player movement tracking data for NFL passing plays leading up to the moment that the forward pass is thrown. The task, and the goal of one competition track, is to predict the ongoing player movement as the football moves through the air. The second competition track is to formulate a metric (or, short of that, a video commentary) that describes some aspect of player movement that is accessible to football professionals (like coaches) and football fans (like most Americans).</p>\"},{\"p\":\"<p>The corpus of relevant research and analysis tools did not take long to assemble: 1. <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xg3nyPNo3s&amp;t=2221s\\\">2023 CMSAC workshop video</a> 2. <a href=\\\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-033021-110117\\\">Kovalchik, Player Tracking Data in Sports</a> 3. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sportsdataverse/sportyR\\\">sportyR</a> 4. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse\\\">NFLverse</a> 5. <a href=\\\"https://nflfastr.com/articles/nflfastR.html\\\">NFLfastr</a> 6. <a href=\\\"https://nflfastr.com/articles/nflfastR.html\\\">Get started with nflfastR</a> 7. <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06122\\\">A Bayesian circular mixed-effects model for explaining variability in directional movement in American football</a> 8. <a href=\\\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17220\\\">NFL Ghosts: A framework for evaluating defender positioning with conditional density estimation</a> 9. <a href=\\\"https://statthinksportsanalytics.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-big-data-bowl-2025\\\">Ron Yurko’s Thoughts on Big Data Bowl 2025</a> 10. <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/lorihe/survival-analysis-on-progress-after-caught\\\">Survival Analysis on Progress after Caught</a> 11. <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/pvabish/modeling-with-transformers-by-sumersports/notebook\\\">Modeling with Transformers</a> 12. <a href=\\\"https://sumersports.com/the-zone/nfl-advanced-stats/\\\">NFL Advanced Stats: How To Use Them and What They Mean</a></p>\"},{\"p\":\"<p>The 2026 BDB competition is a step in the direction of integrating athlete biomechanics into game analysis.

can apply and test different amounts of noise to the contest data and then see how the added noise affects player movement predictions.</p>\"}]}}]}\u001b[39m\n
