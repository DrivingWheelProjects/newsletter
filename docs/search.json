    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to my resurrected sports science and technology newsletter. I've given it a title, the \"Athletes Data Community Newsletter,\" something that reflects my research interests.\nI'm going into my last year of a Computer Science PhD at the University of Vermont and my primary research projects focus on privacy aspects of athletes’ health and performance data. Other papers in preparation: task analysis for athletes' data technologies based on field-based research, athletes' injury risk from an engineering systems perspective, socio-technical impediments and solutions for data sharing in sports. By putting athletes' data front and center I think that it will be possible to discuss the varied aspects of how data gets collected, managed and applied across the full spectrum of sports. At least I hope so.\n\nConcussions in 2025\nflashing smart mouthguards and the growing importance of injury risk awareness\nFootball season is concussion season, according to CNN. Fortunately research in traumatic brain injury continues to advance. A U.S. research team led by a Milwaukee team from St. Luke's Medical Center and Medical College of Wisconsin observed that 75% of football players experienced fewer head impact exposure after return to play. Longer post-concussion recovery led to larger decreases in head impact exposures. Conservative return-to-play management from concussion likely increases athletes' awareness of head impacts and improves their ability to protect themselves.\nAwareness is central to a smart impact-sensing mouthguard with a bright red light that flashes above threshold acceleration values (75g for men, 65g for women, or 4500 radians per second squared). Years ago, research biomedical engineer Eric Nauman (then at Purdue, now at University of Cincinnati) told me that football helmets should have plastic shells that would crack at similar thresholds, and prompt the same response: Get that athlete off the field. The evidence is the urgency, and without both, the decision-making circumstance changes.\nAn athlete, a coach or a referee can all choose to play on without a clear and obivious signal that it is irresponsible to continue. \"Where athletes really get themselves into trouble – they continue to play. They get another, even minor, hit, and the symptoms get even more amplified,\" says Marie Schaefer of Cleveland Clinic. Technology that improves injury risk awareness and accounting is potentially disruptive, but only if norms in sport prioritize risk awareness. The alternative is to attribute sports injury to bad luck and believe that athletes inevitably get hurt.\n\n\nSynthetic Data in Sports\nsynthetic data is important technology for sports at the junction of data science, data sharing and privacy\nPrivacy and data sharing in sports, this is my research in the PhD program at the University of Vermont. Questions about privacy for athletes' health and performance data have largely been unasked, and unanswered. So I am trying to ask them. Expect to see lots more about these subjects in the weeks ahead.\nSynthetic data, it turns out, is a crucial aspect of my research. Synthetic data, data that is produced algorithmically as opposed to being observed or collected, is capable of guaranteeing both privacy and quality and lends itself to widespread sharing. Examples of sports-related synthetic data are just proof of concept at this point. A study out of Ireland uses synthetic data to predict gait stability in an older population. The context is more sports-adjacent than actual sports but the work is a stepping stone to more complex biomechanical movements and more diverse athletic populations. Earlier this summer John Warmenhoven derived a synthetic dataset that showed only numerical acute training load, numerical chronic training load (4-week) and a binary injury data point, all expressed on a per week basis. The paper is a simple how-to and little more, \"an important first step toward better understanding of the utility of synthetic data for the sports and exercise sciences more broadly,\" the authors write.\n\n\nHidden Danger of Gambling\nathletes' performance data is essential information for sports gamblers who seek to create a betting edge based on predictions of players' health, performance and injury\nA lawsuit is working its way through UK courts. A group of Premier League players has sued via \"stop processing\" requests in order to rein in the access that commercial operators have to player performance data. Commercial operators consist of broadcasters, game developers and gambling companies, and they have negotiated data access rights with sports leagues under collective bargaining positions that those leagues have established with its players. Information fuels the analysis of high stakes sports gambling, and no one has higher stakes that the firms that take sports bets. Profiting from sports gambling depends on maintaining an edge that can tilt odds in ways that other bettors cannot expect. The amount of player performance data that is needed to create an edge is substantial, making it somewhat unrealistic at present. The payoff that will come from developing the edge is substantial however.\nHenry Abbott makes the point in a researched essay that team-wide health and stamina are deciding NBA games, displacing some of the importance that star-level talent has in teams' game models.\nLonger-term, performance data has a significant role to play in the personalized care and training that elite athletes increasingly require, according to the Danish authors of Consensus Statement-Optimizing Performance of the Elite Athlete, recently published in the Scandanavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports. The authors write, “Technological innovations are likely to enable the development of personalized training and nutrition strategies in the next decades through emerging technologies. … These innovations may allow for better tailoring of training and nutrition strategies across the varying demands of training and competition.\nAs the personalization advances, analysis of athletes' data should also provide clearer pictures for injury prevention and injury prediction. Nothing about the future of sports scares me more than sports gamblers inventing and then using an edge based on athlete injury prediction."

    "title": "ADCN: Health Algorithms & Interfaces, Data Duty of Care, Injury Reports",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The ADCN newsletter archive can be found at https://newsletter.bradstenger.com. I mention it here for two reasons. First, the site construction needs some attention and some work, and this public announcement will make it more likely to see those improvements occur sooner rather than later. Second, the website has a sign up where anyone can give their email to join ADCN’s mailing list. I’m still soft-launching ADCN but the public launch is coming. Getting the ADCN web presence up and running is a crucial step.\n\nHealth Algorithms and the Lowest Common Denominator\nPersonalization algorithms, in general, do not work so well when those algorithms have to serve thousands (or millions) of users. The situation is a classic case where usability has to function at a lowest common denominator across a population where the variation is substantial.\nFor some people, especially people who trust machine instructions with little or no question, and in terms of demographics this population skews young, there is also an inabilitiy to contextualize recommendations that come from an AI source. Failing to understand AI in context makes human error likely despite confidence that is out of proportion with reality, mostly because reality gets ignored.\nEvery once in a while the scientific literature presents a window into health data recommendation systems and its lowest common denominator. Apple recently published in PLOS One results from the company’s sleep tracking study that took data from more than 35,000 Apple watch wearers who use the device as a sleep tracker. Most sleep data collection occurs in 1-14 day windows, predominantly at the low end, and it under-estimates the night to night sleep variability across populations. Apple simulated longer duration datasets and subsampled that data in an attempt to understand the depth of the problem with short-duration sleep samples.\nApple researchers stratified groups into one-hour intervals, and came to realize that the smaller group of lighter sleepers (6 +/- 1 hours) could not be differentiated from the more common heavier (7 +/- 1 hours) sleepers. “For the planning of future [sleep measurement] studies, there may be a resource and/or participant burden tension between sample size and duration of tracking,” the author conclude, saying “the path to mitigation lies in duration of tracking per participant, more so than boosting cohort sample size.”\nSleep is incredibly complex. Recent mouse studies suggest close links between seasonal variation in diet and circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm may need to be measured for long (probably very long) duration in order to understand seasonal, annual, reproductive, and human life stage variations in sleep, and in turn, recovery and performance. These are evolutionary forces at work where subtle and deep-seated adaptions have major, meaningful implications. Human physiological and cognitive adaptions for running and cooking helped to shape human existence over long term time frames. Is socialized, high exertion, inter-personal competition, also known as sports, fundamentally human and a generator of physiological and cognitive adaption? I wouldn’t rule it out.\nSo what is AI good for when it comes to health and performance data? Arjun Mahajan and Stephen Gilbert gave their opinion in a Nature Digital Medicine essay, “Do we need AI guardians to protect us from health information overload?” Guardians are necessary, they write, because commercial health data devices send too many low-value alerts that miss what a health assistant should target, which are “filtering, contextualizing, and personalizing health information” for users.\nThreshold values in biometric data are a consistently useful interaction that the authors mention, and they do best when the data user specifies the target threshold (like heart rate during zone training). User-specified targets are personalized, contextualized, and filtered, all because a human sets all of those parameters when they go about creating the target alert on their device. Keeping a human in the feedback seems far more useful than a completely automated AI when it comes to data-backed health and performance information.\nSports have coaches. If path to personalization benefits from human input then there should be a place for coaches’ input on behalf of athletes, especially when it comes to determining useful athletes’ thresholds. Putting a coach (or coaches) in the feedback loop should help to avoid low-value alerts and to keep things personal, contextual and filtered. Problems will arise when misaligned incentives prompt coaches to not prioritize athletes’ best interests. In general athletes trust coaches. Give coaches the benefit of the doubt and to make their input for athlete threshold settings a default (or a low-effort optional setting), at least to start.\nHow things start might not be how things end up. There are signs that AI recommendation systems can and will be gamed by a servcice’s self-interests, and not in users’ best interests. A post at Bruce Schneier’s blog describes the phenomena of AI Summary Optimization. The situation is analogous to Search Engine Optimization from 10-15 years ago. AISO is the new SEO. Keywords and content sequences, often jargon, factor into the subjective assessment made by an AI recommender system. Start down the path from automated threshold notification to subjective recommendations and from there it is a slippery slope to low-value alerts.\n\n\nDuty of Care for Data\nThe FAIR consensus reports are a series of review papers that examine “prevention strategies and modifiable risk factors” for female, woman and girl athletes. The papers have been appearing regularly in the British Journal of Sports Medicine and cover their review process and the targets for injury prevention such as concussion, upper extremities, lower extremities, etc. The series recently concluded with articles and essays that discuss dissemination and implementation of FAIR findings and recommendations. The challenge of translating medicine and transferring technology from research to practice is difficult on its easiest day. Any how-to guide will still have difficulty leading interested stakeholders to successful outcomes. Competence and its polar opposite, negligence, are difficult to identify during research translation, and without identifiable best and worst practices, the road map to a better place (or away from a worse place) is not clear or obvious.\nIf there is one guiding principal for athletes’ health it is the idea of duty of care. Duty of care is a legal standard and a social norm and, in general, reflects an individual’s responsibility for the well-being of others. Duty of care means that coaches do not overwork players, that one player does not cheap shot another player, that equipment is safe, that medical staff are available, and any other measure to prevent forseeable harm. Duty of care is also a legal standard, and when breached can result in judgements of negligence and liability.\nDuty of care does not as yet extend to athletes’ data and information, either in its legal or social context. But maybe it should. Duty of care already exists in the context of injury prevention. Greater awareness of its potential application to athletes’ data and information would incentivize action to translate research into practice.\nAnother recent BJSM review paper is an audit of the effect female menstrual cycles have on sports injuries of all types and among all genders. (This was not a FAIR consensus review.) Injury analysis papers, the authors found, look primarily at evidence from male athletes and when they do consider female athletes’ evidence it does not account for hormonal fluctuations, despite the significant bearing that menstrual cycles have on injury occurrence. There’s a case to make that any aggregate injury analysis needs to account for cycles and their role. There’s also a case to make that cycles have enormous variation and it will take great effort to understand and account for the role of menstrual cycles in sports injury. Duty of care would suggest that there is an essential need to understand injury occurrences and prevention. If some analysis that takes shortcuts can help, those studies are valuable. But there is also an obligation to do the difficult, time-consuming work to understand the full scope of athlete injuries.\nConcussions, among all athletes, have long been a duty of care quagmire. Recall how long it took for American football to recognize its problem with concussions. Looking the other way was far easier than solving the difficult problem of football concussions when solutions meant changing fundamentals of the game, but eventually duty of care was applied and change happened. Concussion diagnosis still does not have objective criteria and relies on athletes’ self-reporting (often reluctant). Canada’s Sport Information Resource Centre took the stance that concussion symptoms reporting is a shared “duty of care” responsibility that cuts across all sports’ participants and at every level. Sports participation should not exist within a broader sports culture “that tolerates (and sometimes celebrates) pain and injury, and privileges performance over health,” the authors write. The authors are sport injury researchers at Canadian universities and they emphasize awareness and communication in their “it takes a village” solution.\nA recent meeting among Michigan high school sports administrators pointed to the considerable costs, inconsistent practices, and high stakes, the greatest of which are to athletes who are false-positives and pass their on-field cognitive evalutation. The need is for fast, accurate concussion exams in a Canada-like framework that prioritizes long-term health and well-being.\nThe legal dimension to duty of care makes it intimidating to cite duty of care in any context where there is risk of litigation. Personal injury law can be seen working at the periphery of sports to call out negligence and liability. The more important context is athletes’ health and well-being however, and duty of care should motivate the advances in sports management and coaching practice that research and technology make possible.\n\n\nInjury Reports\nHaralabob Voulgaris made tens of millions of dollars as a professional gambler on sports. Speaking with Pablo Torre on a podcast Voulgaris said that the NBA has a real integrity problem when it came to the team injury reports, especially with regard to the relationship between those reports and gambling. Voulgaris did not cite any specific example of improper or illegal activity but did describe how different teams approach the injury reports differently, with varying levels of effort and accuracy. Injury report information is crucial to serious sports gamblers who are anxious to know anything that could favor (or disfavor) their action. The team-by-team differences in report production and quality make it difficult to police public information which make it possible for insider information to leak (or spill) out in sports gambling contexts.\nThe news about injury reports is not really about the NBA though. The NCAA now requires player availability reports for the 2026 men’s and women’s Division 1 basketball tournaments. Public injury reports have been required for football in the SEC, Big Ten, ACC and Mid-American conferences. The SEC and ACC also require reports for men’s and women’s basketball, and for baseball. The NCAA pointed out that the reports keep gambling interests from interacting directly with student-athletes about their health status.\nA medical school student and two professors wrote an opinion essay in the medical news outlet STAT, saying that the personal information contained in team injury reports would constitute a serious privacy violation if they had not been subject to collective bargaining and contractual language between the athletes and their leagues. The origin of injury reports dates to 1947 when the NFL commission learned of dramatic shifts in betting leading up to a game where a flu had significantly compromised one team. The authors, two Yale doctors and a Case Western lawyer, say that it’s enough to say that an athlete will not compete, and any potentially invasive details are not necessary. As NCAA athletes become more subject to injury reporting requirements there is no indication who or how anyone will defend their privacy interests in the disclosures."

    "title": "ADCN: Biomarkers, Player Tracking Viz, Womens Update",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Biomarkers\nA report in The Athletic described new saliva-sampling analysis technology that is gaining customers among European soccer teams. Biolyz is a startup company based in Austria that has biosampling and transport methods to rapidly process saliva in order to quantify the athlete-relevant biomarkers using mass spectrometry, a very effective technology for separating and identifying molecules in a biological sample. The collect-send-report process is a step back from the wearable biomarker identification that has been under development for the past 10+ years. It is however a big step forward for commercial metabolomics, a field that 20 years ago focused more on plants than on people.\nMetabolism refers to the human body’s energy systems where nutrients, air and water come in so that work, heat and waste can go out. Metabolomics is a deep deep hole to explore. Metabolomic pathways in human biology rely on building blocks like amino acids and proteins, carbohydrates and sugars, lipids and fatty acids, and last, nucleotides and enzymes that are coordinators for gene expression and chemical reactions in the body.\nBiolyz references 125 biomarkers that are relevant to athletic performance, a number that scratches the surface of what’s actually going on biochemically. Mass spectrometry, the detection technology used by Biolyz, can identify thousands of metabolites in a biosample, but achieving that precision requires controlled material handling and sample preparation. Biolyz sacrifices precision in favor of easy collection and fast turnaround while still providing adequate depth of information to describe personal attributes that are characteristic of an individual athletes’ metabolism.\nCould something like Biolyz work for high stakes professional and college sports leagues in the U.S.? The compact geography of Europe works in favor of Biolyz’ rapid processing. The company’s academic roots also set Biolyz up to translate and commercialize what had been a research project. T\nTwo paths to create a similar service might work in American sports. Regional sports mass spec labs could spin up in places with large enough athlete and technician populations, helped by investment from deep-pocketed sports team(s) who want the competitive advantage. Alternatively, global mass spec manufacturers like Thermo Rest or Agilent might look to sports as a way to increase their public profile with the attention that partnership with a sports league offers.\nFor comparison, sample testing on drawn blood in the U.S. takes 7-14 days and returns 50-70 biomarkers. Blood test cost hundreds of dollars despite (or maybe because of) the nationwide network of medical and lab infrastructure that supports blood testing.\nThe manual collection of saliva is not especially high-tech (even though economical, rapid, refrigerated sample transport has real technical challenges). One more technical approach is to use micro- and nano-scale engineering to rapidly sample, analyze and report for metabolites in some kind of wearable form factor. Commercial and research progress into analysis of interstitial fluids is an example, led by the success of wearable continuous glucose monitor (CGMs) patches. Interstitial fluid exists below the surface of the skin. Micro-size needles can access and gather the fluid without triggering nerve cell responses. Electrodes detect the volume of glucose in the presence of enzymes and a radio transmits the data to a receiver or a phone app.\nJason Heikenfeld, an engineer at the University of Cincinnati, is the inventor of the sweat biomarker detector that eventually became Gatorade’s sweat patch. He thinks that interstitial fluid is capable of more robust biochemical analysis and has founded a company, Kilele Health, to develop the technology. University of Pittsburgh researchers have created tests for interstitial fluid that detect drugs (marijuana, fentanyl) and, in other circumstances, antibodies responding to infections (like COVID). These are specific electro-chemical tests that work like CGMs. Heikenfeld’s new startup plans to develop new classes of bioaffinity sensors based on CRISPR-type enzymes for gene sequence recognition, though it will take work to extend the longevity and stability of these chemical processes in order to incorporate the new technology into a wearable.\nWhat is becoming increasingly apparent is that concurrent biometric, activity and biomarker data add to a sum that is greater its parts. The latest Epicore sweat sensor combines electro-chemical sodium detection with skin temperature sensors and an accelerometer to measure activity-level. Borussia Dortmund uses the Biolyz biomarker panel alongside player-tracking and athlete health-performance data. Whoop, makers of a consumer biometric-sensing band, introduced a biomarker lab service to complement the algorithmic recommendations based on wearables data. Orreco, a rapid blood biomarker service for professional teams based in Ireland, will be integrating its data with motion-tracking data sources from Sportradar and Data Driven Sports Analytics, an Australian computer vision company.\n\n\nVisualizing Player Tracking Data\nPlayer tracking in sports has evolved, albeit slowly, over the fifteen years that the technology has been around. Early on, the athletes’ time and distance measurements helped to establish “training load” as an catch-all metric that accounts for the work from training and from competition that an athlete experiences. Training load would, in turn, foster a second metric called “Acute-Chronic Workload Ratio” that added (a little) context to athlete work measurement.\nWearable heartrate measurement systems have been around since before player tracking, and it took some time to realize how valuable biometrics are in terms of workload. I remember my first GPS running watch, a Nike-TomTom collaboration, that showed time-distance only. Progress when the data consists of the speed and distance of your runs is knowing that you’ve gone faster or further, so I was always trying to go faster and further. Overuse injuries were common in my experience, like every couple of months.\nACWR was thought to be a way to manage injury risk but that theory did not hold up. Statistical analysis showed that any increase in measured injuries that correlated with a high ACWR was just as likely to be the result of increased exposures to injuries (as in more training, more practices, more games) as it was to be the result of the recent high volume of athletes’ work.\nThe best current example that links player tracking to injury risk comes from sports statisticians at the University of North Carolina. Kendall Thomas and Jan Hannig presented, Movement Dynamics in Elite Female Soccer Athletes: The Quantile Cube Approach at the last New England Symposium on Statistics in Sports. The “quantile cube” is a data visualization that attempts to capture the complexity of athletes’ movement. The premise is that the wear and tear an athlete experiences increases as athletes move faster and change direction more frequently. Game tracking data is especially useful because the higher stakes (compared to practice or training) should correspond to maximum (or at least higher) exertion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper, the methods and the visual presentation suggest that more exploratory analysis with player tracking data is called for. Thomas and Hannig show player tracking averages for half-games, consistent with their objective to show macro-level trends throughout a season of games. Player tracking data is typically measured at between 10-30 frames per second, meaning that lots of information is lost when half-games are the standard for precision.\nThe opposite extreme is to display each data point and see the patterns that emerge in high-density data visualization for player tracking data. For example, this is what one weekend of NFL games worth of pass receiver tracking looks like (from 2026 Big Data Bowl data).\n\nOne further benefit from exploratory data visualization for player tracking data should be as a stepping stone toward synthetic data for athlete biomechanics. If visual methods can get close to representing athlete movement signatures with something that can be easily inspected, it should make it possible to gain confidence in sythetic data that generates realistic athlete movement patterns. Synthetic data is, I think, important for increasing the volume of data shared throughout sports, something that should improve causal analysis between biomechanics and injuries.\n\n\nWomens Research Update\nUS Soccer announced a $30 million grant from Michelle Kang to create the Kang Institute, a global hub for womens athletic research. The institute’s “first study will focus on the needs of players by targeting research around injury prevention, mental health, workload management, menstrual health, and the transition from youth to elite competition,” which seems like a lot, according the NBC News reporting. The anticipated work products will be research and documenting best practices based on the research, along with an education mission.\nThe initiative has the unprecedented objective of sharing the research work products with competing nations and teams. Lex Chalat, director of Soccer Forward Foundation, told NBC News, “We want to support other countries in developing their best practices and developing and understanding how to raise the bar in their country as well.”\nGeorgie Brunvels is now the research innovation lead for US Soccer. She is a respected voice in womens’ sports and research, 0 USWNT coach Emma Hayes at Chelsea FC and with Jill Ellis and Dawn Scott on the 2019 USWNT World Cup victory.\nThe idea to document best practices is something that KI has in common with FAIR. FAIR stands for the Female, woman and/or girl Athlete Injury pRevention group organized by the International Olympic Committee. The FAIR Consensus recommendations got input from 109 authors who participated in an eight-step process. The primary prevention recommendations are shown below.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance held its Female Athlete Research Meeting last month at Stanford. According to presenter Emily Kraus, FARM started as a weekly meeting among Stanford’s Wu Tsai group who worked on women’s sports. This was the first time that the Stanford FARM group opened up the conversation to a broader audience. Four hundred attended.\nDiscussing the research in settings like the FARM meeting is at least as important as doing the research. The enthusiasm and intelligence on display in the researchers’ work was impressive, as were the helpful, insightful questions and thoughts posed by attendees and panelists. Progress is in hand and underway across the collective at FARM and at Wu Tsai."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a lengthy rundown on women athletes’ health and performance research. The news peg for it is the announcement of a new University of Indiana initiative, which gave me a chance to look at the bigger picture. Short answer, it’s in a much better place than it was in five or ten years ago. And there is a good chance that it could snowball, as the research raises more questions and technology advances new ways to answer those questions. You, the readers, can expect overviews like this as opportunities to come up to speed on crucial subjects materialize. I thank you for your attention.\n\nIndiana University Female Sports Performance and Research Initiative\nand a rundown of women athletes research\nIndiana University recently announced a women athletes research initiative in partnership with Indiana Sports Corp and Pacers Sports & Entertainment. No dollar or grant-specific information was forthcoming but the program’s research committee co-chair, Katie Siek, is a revealing choice. Siek is professor of informatics and a human- and health-centered computer scientist. (The other co-chair of the research committee is Avinash Chandran, whose work is also discussed in this newsletter.) “Our whole goal here is to actually collect that data and help create interactive systems so that athletes can get better information to improve their health, and the health care system can better provide support for them,” Siek told the Indianapolis Record news organization.\nSports research has been gaining currency in the computing research community that focuses on human-centered computing and human-computer interaction. After a major conference workshop in 2024 sports researchers in the community published Grand Challenges in SportsHCI which stated that “we believe in the benefit of generating fundamental knowledge for SportsHCI more broadly to advance the field as a whole. To achieve this, we aim to identify the grand challenges in SportsHCI, which can help researchers and practitioners in developing a future research agenda.” University of Florida researchers published follow-up work last spring, Coach, Data Analyst, and Protector: Exploring Data Practices of Collegiate Coaching Staff that enlisted coaches for focus groups and found that “coaching staff selectively use data with the goal of balancing performance goals, athlete emotional well-being, and privacy.” Siek has studied prototypes of DaVinci Wearables’ technology that tracks female athlete physiology through biometrics (body temperature, galvanic skin response, body composition, cycle tracking) and assists athletes in reaching performance goals.\nA sports research initiative based on computing is a new kind of interdisciplinary hub for this work. The Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance based primarily at Stanford University is broadly based in medical and life science. The University of Michigan Human Performance & Sport Science Center resides in the School of Kinesiology. The FIFA Women’s Football Development Programme takes a soccer-centric approach. The International Olympic Committee has created the Female, woman, and girl Athlete Injury pRevention (FAIR) consensus.\nPapers, conferences and spinouts are a good indicator for when a research initiative has hit critical mass and has impact. The FIFA Women’s group has a set of papers, many attempting to define benchmarks for elite women athletes, covering injury events and recovery parameters (links). The FAIR consensus has also produced a series of expert reviews on gender affects and prevention strategies for sport-related injury. The group also recently held the Female, Woman, and Girl Athlete Health and Safety Summit at the University of Calgary. The sixth editon of the Female Athlete Conference took place last spring in Boston and conference founder Kate Ackerman is the director of the new Women’s Health, Sports & Performance Institute, a translational sports medicine research center outside Boston. Stanford and Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance will host its inaugural Female Athlete Research Meeting (FARM) in November.\n\n\nBayesian Injury Rate Estimation\na shift is underway from “frequentist” to “Bayesian” injury surveillance analysis\nA couple of recent papers by Avinash Chandran announce a shift in the way that the NCAA does injury surveillance. Chandran describes the change as moving from a “frequentist” approach to a Bayesian approach in two papers: The Practical Value of Bayesian Inference in Describing the Epidemiology of Sports Injuries from Sports Medicine journal, and Bayesian methods for estimating injury rates in sport injury epidemiology from Injury Epidemiology journal. Chandran is the injury epidemiologist in charge of the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program for the Datalys Center, a non-profit collaborative research organization originally founded by the NCAA and the American College of Sports Medicine.\nThe difference between frequentist and Bayesian is almost as stark as analysis before and after the emergence of data science. Frequentist approaches center on counts and the traditional practice of statistical hypothesis tests, statistical significance and p-values. Bayesian approaches, in general, can take any and all prior information and then use that information to calculate posterior probabilities for the likelihood of statistical events. The frequentist approach is what it is, while the Bayesian approach iterates and evolves as meaningful prior information is applied. The change is a crucial progress step for injury surveillance and, potentially, for the NCAA.\nWhy you ask? Injury surveillance has its benchmark measurement, called injury rate, which in frequentist terms is the number of injury occurrences divided by the number of injury exposures. Chandran’s workflow for an injury rate Bayesian model looks like this. \nNew information that will improve injury rate calculation are coming. Biometric, biomechanical and biomarker information now present a more in-depth picture of athletes’ ongoing physiology along with essential recovery and fatigue details. The rate-limiting step probably is not going to be the lag in completing the studies to merge the new information. More likely the greater lag will come from organizing the athletes’ data into coherent pathways for causal analysis of athletes’ injuries that can make the sum of all the investigations greater than its parts. The NCAA and its Sports Science Institute could champion the effort, and so could the federal government if it decides to play a role in managing college sports. Professional sports leagues could also provide a guiding hand, and as a result become a major beneficiary of the research.\n\n\nHot Hand and Talent Evaluation\nextending the Hot Hand Fallacy to front office decision-making\nThe hot-hand fallacy has been a talking point since Amos Tversky and colleagues first identified the hot-hand in the 1980s.\nThe idea is simple. Recent success increases the likelihood of future success. The classic case, the one Tversky identified, is the basketball player who makes a few shots in a row, prompting both the player and teammates to expect the next shot to go in as well. The premise has been rebutted and amended by psychologists, economists and statisticians seeking ground truth for what is more accurately called a heuristic. That heuristic is often (but not always) a source of bad decisions and bad outcomes. A couple of recent articles prompted me to ask if the front office decision-making is as prone to hot-handedness as the players on the court, ice, pitch or field.\n“The relationship between cash and winning in the NFL is complicated,” Mike Sando writes at the start of his September 12 article at The Athletic, Ranking NFL teams by spending: The boldest, most frugal and best bang for the buck. Front offices make personnel decisions with varying degrees of confidence and uncertainty. No organization gets every transaction right. But string together personnel wins, whether by draft, trade or free agency and it shows up as wins on the field. To believe that an organization’s decision process is more sound than lucky is to play the hot hand. When that happens the team-wide regression to the mean is imminent.\nSome singular moves can turn out bo be force multipliers according to Sando’s analysis. The Chiefs pay less than market value for an All-World quarterback. The Rams have a superior coach known to do more with less. Some teams have a philosophy that raises their floor. The Eagles always choose to spend money on talent when given the opportunity. The Steelers spend lots more on defense than on offense.\n“When one contention window closes, another one opens,” Dom Luszczyszyn and Scott Wheeler write at the start of their September 17 article, also at The Athletic, The NHL Contention Cycle: Where does each team stand going into 2025-26 and in the future? Like the NFL, teams are all over the place with some rising and others falling. The regression to the mean among NHL hockey teams is maybe more random, and therefore more unavoidable, than NFL football teams if you agree that title contention is cyclical.\nLiverpool has held on to its elite position in the Premiere League despite significant squad turnover. This last article, originally from OneFootball’s Anfield Index blog, describes how the team’s sports science and medical department play a crucial role in talent evaluation. The athletes’ health and performance information was part of the team’s big-money decisions to extend Mohammad Sala’s contract (despite his advanced age) and to acquire Alexander Isak (despite his injury concerns). Another article, again by The Athletic, provides an in-depth analysis of Liverpool’s summer transfer ins and outs. Hidden in the details is how Will Spearman, director of research, championed the signing of Hugo Ekitike, comparing his age-grade statistics to Haaland and Mbappe. If there is an overarching philosophy, Liverpool shows a strong desire to stay young, “Every player Liverpool signed, with the exception of backup goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, is aged 25 or under.” Has the squad’s front office operators raised the team’s floor, or is the inevitable regression to the mean coming? Liverpool’s season is off to a fantastic start but it’s a long season ahead."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Bumps in the road to regular newsletter production. I think that there will progress toward a weekly ADCN newsletter between now and the end of the year. Once I achieve some consistency I should be able to end the “soft” launch phase that we need to work through. PhD research is, in its way, a content pipeline. The key to regular newsletter production will be wrestling the PhD content pipeline into something readable. Thanks for your patience.\n\nJournaling with Wearables\n“Expert in yourself” is not yet a norm but among high achievers in business and sports it is headed that way. Type A personalities drive the connection between data and habits since the technology is not quite easy enough to use. Call this stuff more of a really-want-to than a need-to at this point but the utility (and probably usability too) increasing dramatically as the benefit to cost ratio increases in the near future. Read on for why the big benefits are coming, and for why personal privacy is a factor.\nHabits are personal behaviors. They defy universal generalization but there is an emerging consensus that gaining some habits (like gym-going) are harder and gaining other habits (like hand-washing) are easier. Self-awareness about what’s healthy, productive, or both healthy and productive, might be the shortest path for someone trying to make a habit out of good habits. Atomic Habits, as put forward by author James Clear, is less a personal guide to habit-formation than it is a guide to self- and environmental-awareness so that you can give yourself the best chance to succeed at habit change.\nHigh achievers often execute on a long development arc. It is not just talent, there is also an endurance factor where sustained improvement progresses year-over-year, sometimes decade-over-decade. No short cuts. Work life incorporates personal habits and self-expertise. Overall, self-knowledge takes guesswork out of finding effective collaborators and, when there is no collaboration, self-fulfillment plugs any gaps with still more self-development productivity.\nA constraints-led approach (CLA) to training is learning methodology that attempts to expedite high-level skill development by imposing constraints. The thoughtful design of the constraints comes from a coach or trainer who knows CLA and perception-action coupling, a kind of meta-cognition where sensemaking in a realistic and constrained training scenario informs future behavior. It’s a higher-order habit meant to create situational preparedness in high-pressure, complex, future settings.\nWhat if you just want to eat less bacon, or improve sleep hygiene? Garmin recently added a “Life Logging” feature to many of the company’s recent edition sport watches. The feature matches a popular aspect of Whoop biometric-tracking bracelets. The on-screen reminders delivered to your watch attach information to a wide range of daily (the typical time interval) wellness observables. The lightweight interaction is a straightforward way to connect behavior to performance when the goal is to change both of those things. Reporting by The New York Times suggests that high-performing business executives are doing something like this with Oura rings.\nResearch technologies are coming that will reduce the cognitive overhead for tracking and adopting habits. Northwestern researchers combine 2 wearables (wrist + necklace), 1 body camera, and a phone app to thoroughly document research subjects’ eating habits. The system gets high-fidelity gesture data from the wearables, and the body camera also recognizes activity signatures that are unique to eating. The product of this research is an effective diagnostic, showing that overeating takes multiple forms and the patterns have emotional, behavioral and contextual dimensions. Work continues, and the hope is for clinicians to use these same tools for personalization and support to enable habit changes.\nMyFoodRepo is a picture-based meal-tracking app developed by Marcel Salathe and his team at EPFL in Switzerland. The researchers combined their meal tracking with ongoing checks of microbe populations in subject microbiomes. Gut health (specifically, gut diversity), they found, depends on how consistently a person eats well, and not just on what a person’s nutrition intake is like. Habits are central to basic body function.\nPrivacy protection is crucial given the personal aspects of habits. That becomes more true as the stakes elevate for good habits and personal health. Athletes are going to experience higher stakes when habits go under a microscope based on the public nature of sports performance. Understanding habit formation needs to go hand in hand with understanding how to keep that information private.\n\n\nStacks vs. Open, Why Choose?\nHudl recently described a research meeting between the company and Mexican university researchers on the company blog. Hudl is among the first sports technology companies to deliver a software “stack.” Software stacks go back the 2000s when most every dynamic website ran on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql, Perl/Php/Python). The essential pieces for a sports infrastructure stack are: 1. athletes’ data collection, 2. athletes’ data management, 3. athletes’ data analysis, and 4. athletes’ data reporting. The integration of the pieces, done as seamlessly as possible, make for a stack and make that stack a more useful product than any of the singular pieces by themselves. Teamworks is the other company that makes a sports stack for teams to buy.\nThe risk to a team who buys a stack is lock-in, a combination of dependence on and reluctance to leave a technology platform. Lock-in, according to technology journalist and activist Cory Doctorow, is the first step to enshittification (platform decay) which occurs when companies with lots of dependent customers prioritize exerting control over customers, instead of delivering value to customers.\nThe LAMP stack was (still is) Open Source technology, which effectively steered it away from enshittification. Open Source (and the related Open Data) is a way to prioritize customer value over long term time windows. The Open Source software model demonstrated by LAMP also scaled well, supporting the explosive growth that the Internet experienced as it got its legs during the early 21st Century. Calls for Open methods and shared infrastructure and practices like this by Garret Bullock and this by Natalie Kupperman promote the awareness and benefits of community stakeholding.\nResearch participation is different in closed and in open platforms. How? Social media data (Facebook, Twitter) used to be widely available and no-cost. Companies met the demand from researchers and developers with APIs. Years ago I wrote about how the APIs to customize sports software was not being demanded or created, and I am not sure how much progress has been made in the time since. End-user programming, as I wrote, is the bottom-up expression of demand for Open infrastructure and data. At present, Open research in sports exists, but not at scales large enough to be useful.\nTop-down progress does not necessarily lead to enshittification. Bottom-up progress does not necessarily gain traction to reach broad-based utility. The need is for some optimizaton of both, top-down and bottom-up, to create a check and balance that guarantees customer value from their sports software.\n\n\nBig Data Bowl 2026\nThe NFL announced the criteria for its 2026 Big Data Bowl (BDB), the annual competition where anyone can take real NFL game data and then answer important (to the NFL at least) research questions. Submissions are judged and cash prizes are given. The combination of real-world data and the accessibility of the Kaggle coding competitions platform makes BDB something far less intimidating than you might expect. There is an engaged community (that includes the NFL researchers who put forward the competition research questions and data set) and the nature of the competition is easy enough to understand and not so cutthroat. The NFL wants to gain deeper insight from the location-tracking data that wearable sensors measure for each player on the field, at a rate of 10 frames per second (in the Kaggle competition data set).\nThe BDB competition has one data set and two tracks. The data set is player movement tracking data for NFL passing plays leading up to the moment that the forward pass is thrown. The task, and the goal of one competition track, is to predict the ongoing player movement as the football moves through the air. The second competition track is to formulate a metric (or, short of that, a video commentary) that describes some aspect of player movement that is accessible to football professionals (like coaches) and football fans (like most Americans).\nThe corpus of relevant research and analysis tools did not take long to assemble: 1. 2023 CMSAC workshop video 2. Kovalchik, Player Tracking Data in Sports 3. sportyR 4. NFLverse 5. NFLfastr 6. Get started with nflfastR 7. A Bayesian circular mixed-effects model for explaining variability in directional movement in American football 8. NFL Ghosts: A framework for evaluating defender positioning with conditional density estimation 9. Ron Yurko’s Thoughts on Big Data Bowl 2025 10. Survival Analysis on Progress after Caught 11. Modeling with Transformers 12. NFL Advanced Stats: How To Use Them and What They Mean\nThe 2026 BDB competition is a step in the direction of integrating athlete biomechanics into game analysis. That’s what Luke Camarao and I have in mind for our submission. If it goes well and we have useful prediction and analytics algorithms for player movement during NFL pass plays then I might also have a starting point to generate synthetic data, something where I can apply and test different amounts of noise to the contest data and then see how the added noise affects player movement predictions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Reading into Systems\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team recently posted a job announcement for a new Director, Baseball Systems. I read it closely out of curiosity. The way someone (or some group) writes about “systems” says a lot about what they know and because of that, a lot about who they are.\nThere is really no ceiling to how complex a piece of systems writing can get. The University of Vermont will be giving me a Certificate of Graduate Study in Complex Systems along with my PhD. These courses were dense with statistics, math, non-linear dynamics and network science. It can be difficult to discuss this systems stuff with knowledge and clarity. So I always appreciate how someone else handles the material. The author’s confidence or uncertainty always comes through in the writing.\nThe Diamondbacks’ Systems job description was not written by an expert systems person. As I read it, the team wants a senior computing professional to elevate the technical capacity of Arizona’s Baseball Operations group. The systems in question are not very specific, probably just databases, cloud infrastructure and the interfaces connecting everything.\nThe role as written requires “strong ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.” Non-technical communication can be a net negative when the systems are a work-in-progress and those systems represent a technical leap forward for an organization. Better to build first and explain later. An organization with a better handle on “systems” would know that.\nFor comparison, look at how the Los Angeles Dodgers called up a University of Wisconsin particle physics and data science professor, seeking brains to add to the team’s Quantitative group.\n\nThe path to advanced “systems” understanding goes through consultants. (Full disclosure: I consult.) In top-level European soccer, analytics consultants are a crucial step toward realizing technical competence inside a sports organization. This Hudl soccer consultant does a good explaining why. (See below.) Hiring a new singlehanded Director to establish new systems where none (or shit) existed before is a mistake.\n\nPrivacy-enhancing technology is, in general, not simple conceptually. The implementation of the technology takes work. The execution of analysis with the privacy-altered (often synthetic) data is, again, not simple. Incorporating all of this into Operations asks for confidence and competence. In most circumstances those capabilities are reflected in how an organization writes (or speaks) on technical subjects. “Systems” writing is a one place to make these judgements.\n\n\nAntetokounmpo: Strains and Stakes\nGiannis Antetokounmpo is in the news. His impending trade from the team he led to an NBA championship is one thing. The other thing is his nagging calf strain which has him off the court and on the injured reserve. The two are related.\nHigh-stakes competition is a below-the-surface element of injury risk. The Pacers admitted that they would have chosen to sit Tyrese Halliburton if the games where he was injured were not NBA Finals games. When managing injury risk boils down to a play or don’t-play decision, it ceases to be a actual decision when the stakes are high. As a result injury risk skyrockets. Antetokounmpo’s team, the Milwaukee Bucks, still has a chance to make the playoffs if its best player can get them there. There are no predictive models to say what’s too much or too far to push an athlete. Antetokounmpo is smart to ask out of Milwaukee and in doing so avoid the competitive gauntlet that stands to wreck his body, and possibly his career.\nI did a longer analysis of risk models, calf strains and ruptured Achilles tendons last year. Read it here.\n\n\nSurveillance and Wearables in Tennis\nAthletes’ data and privacy affected this year’s Australian Open tennis tournament—twice. Tournament officals enforced a ban on wearable fitness devices, primarily Whoop bands. Then surveillance camera images showed an unsuspecting Coco Gauff destroying equipment. Gauff thought she had privacy.\nThe ban on wristbands to track heartrate and other biometric measures by the Australian Open is meant to prevent messages coming to the player, messages that could provide a competitive advantage. Whoop devices are a platform where developers can extend what’s possible with the technology and create custom (or commercial) services. The custom services are more likely to send than to receive data, but a Whoop can get notifications from a cell phone. The same is true for Garmin devices that have a slightly different business and service model from Whoop. (Garmin is close to announcing its version of a Whoop-like wearable device.)\nTournament officials pointed out that optical tracking data (provided by Bolt6 at the Australian Open) is available to players’ support teams, though the tracking data is not as useful as the biometric information from a wearable. Heartrate data has proven extremely valuable for endurance athletes. Major-tournament tennis is absolutely an endurance sport. The televised tennis product benefits from long rallies and five-set matches between the game’s best athletes.\nThe second incident where Coco Gauff vented has been followed by requests from other tour players to establish limits on how exposed they are to the public eye. Backroom athlete surveillance and the resulting exposure is in line with established legal precedents despite the outcry. Those precedents put paid athletes alongside the range of public figures for whom diminished privacy is the social and legal norm.\nUnwanted surveillance is also a problem with biometrics and location trackers. The University of Oregon summarized the issue in a 2024 news release. According to UO sports and culture professor Courtney Cox, “The Moneyball concept has evolved somewhat into chasing the perfect algorithm for sports. It has also evolved in other ways: Where is the barrier between safety and surveillance? If you’re watching me sleep, does my sleep determine whether you let me start or keep my scholarship?”\nDaniel Solove is a leading U.S. authority on law and privacy. In his yearend review he called DOGE and unsolicited data collection by the U.S. federal government “the greatest data breach in history.” Solove’s just-released legal journal article documents the typology of privacy harms. And here he makes the point that the misuse of personal data has disproportionate impact on marginalized groups.\n\nStrava, the social network for all-levels running and biking, has been plagued by surveillance leaks where military and security workers have been compromised by astute followers analyzing the public tracks on Strava.\nGetting privacy practices right is an issue for athletes at every level: professional, college, youth and recreational.\n\n\nNews\n\nOpenSim Creator: An Interactive User Interface for Building OpenSim Musculoskeletal Models by Adam Kewley, Julia van Beesel, Ajay Seth in The Journal of Open Source Software on January 9, 2026\n‘Match load’ construct in professional football: complexities and considerations by Ben Dixon, Jill Alexander, Damian Harper in BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine on January 20, 2026\nAt home with Jakob Ingebrigtsen: ‘I’ve fed my obsession my whole life’ by Sean Ingle in The Guardian on January 23, 2026\nThe Transfer Portal: Visualized - A CFB Network Analysis by Caleb Chandler in reddit/r/CFB on January 16, 2026\nThe Billion Dollar Bleed by Will Carroll in Substack, Under the Knife newsletter on January 22, 2026\nA Systems Engineering Framework for U.S. Biathlon: Variance Reduction, Talent Identification, and Infrastructure Design by Kyle Gschwend in SSRN on January 12, 2026\nMLB 2026: Inside Driveline’s hitting lab by Alden Gonzalez in ESPN.com on January 30, 2026"

    "text": "The Athletes Data Community Newsletter (ADCN) is produced by Brad Stenger, a researcher studying applied privacy technologies in the context of athletes’ data at the University of Vermont. The newsletter covers the athletes’ health and performance data pipeline, from collection to management to reporting, and the factors affecting athletes’ data. Thanks for reading!\n\nUniversity Research in Open Biomechanics\nThe KneeHub project just published an update to a biomechanics models benchmarking study first published in 2021. KneeHub was conceived as a way to determine what’s art and what’s science in the process of constructing biomechanical models. Five teams independently developed knee biomechanics models using their preferred workflow. Different workflows produced different predictions for the same scenarios. But all of the differences in the models’ results could be explained. “Our most important conclusion,” the authors wrote, is “the ability of [biomechanics] models to predict beyond the conditions used to calibrate them.”\nThe result offers useful validation for personalized approaches to neuromuscular rehabilitation. Another recent advance comes from B.J. Fregly’s group at Rice University. The Neuromusculoskeletal Modeling (NMSM) Pipeline software “allows researchers to work in collaboration with clinicians to construct personalized neuromusculoskeletal computer models of individual patients (i.e., digital twins)” then use those models for surgical or neuromuscular rehabilitation treatments. The digital twin gives clinicians the opportunity to explore and test treatment paths, leading to greater confidence in expected outcomes.\nResearchers at the University of California-San Diego combine biomechanical models of athletic training movements with an AI that informs physiological and biomuscular limitation to create models (and videos) that can differentiate risk in athletes’ training movements. The work is early-stage and the research team plans to add to the number of training movements and incorporate personalization.\nThis is, I think, what you want to see for progress in Open computational biomechanics. The innovations are not just data, or software, or process. University researchers are pushing in all of those directions at the same time with their projects.\n\n\nU.S. Sport Policy Coming Through Congress (Or Not)\n\nThe last two weeks had more mentions of college athlete rights than the last two years. It’s a low bar. There hasn’t been very many mentions.\nThe change in public sports vocabulary comes, in large part, from new federal legislation timed to coincide with the annual NCAA Convention held in Washington DC and the College Football Playoff Title game between Miami and Indiana (not in Washington DC). The noise in government circles was captured by The Hill’s Dominick Mastrangelo who wrote, “Lawmakers in both parties are outraged at the NCAA and signaling intervention from Congress on athlete compensation and revenue sharing is inevitable.”\nMore of the cacophony around college sports legislation suggests the opposite, that Congressional intervention in U.S. college sports is a work in progress. Nothing here is actually inevitable, or even seems close to resolution. Distrust for the NCAA is high, making the anti-trust excemption that is central to initial legislation difficult to justify, especially since anti-trust and court judgements are the main recourse for college student-athletes who lack for the rights that employees have (just for being employees).\nSports law reporter Michael McCann calls federal legislation “doomed from the start.” Law scholars Sam Ehrlich and Ryan Rodenberg write that the oversight granted to the NCAA with an anti-trust excemptioon is probably unconstitutional.\nUncertainty around the NCAA has created an enforcement void. Reporting by Ross Dellenger noted that the House settlement has not been effective rule-making due to nonexistant penalties. Conferences are ready to step in, University of Georgia president Jere Morehead, a former chair of the NCAA DI Board of Directors, told Dellenger. “We’d be able to make a much stronger argument that we are not in violation of antitrust rules because we don’t have market power.”\nAn example of enforcement on a smaller conference-level scale is the 2023 Jim Harbaugh suspension for sign-stealing during a football championship season which preceded NCAA penalties. Rodenberg, in another legal journal article, writes that conferences have an anti-competitive blank check if they’re willing to use it, citing how the Ivy League unilaterly refused scholarships to athletes.\nThe timing for all of this discussion around college football’s biggest game is no coincidence. The dollars coming to college football winners (schools, conferences, the NCAA and broadcasters) are substantial. The major federal legislation to intervene in college sports has been consistent with a money grab. Student-athlete interests, outside of the small number of big-money sports (football, basketball), factor little into the college sports money grab.\nExcept, maybe not. Athlete rights figured prominently in the discussion at the Congressional College Athletics Summit organized by Massachusetts Representative Lori Trahan. Trahan, a former college volleyball player, sponsored the latest example of college sports intervention legislation, the College Athletics Reform Act. At the Summit, anti-trust attorney Julia Duncan made the point that college athletes have no seat at the bargaining table, something that will not change much if the NCAA and its member schools gain an anti-trust excemption.\nThese are the early days of sport policy in the U.S., which is to say the public policy around sport. Australia is a country that has had government sport policy for 50 years, going back to the nation’s dismal performance in the Montreal Olympics, according to a research paper by University of Canberra professor Charles Mountifield.\nMountifield makes the point that where sport policy had at first been a national sports participation initiative, it has lately become a professional athlete and sports media policy. Also of late, Australia is a mostly sedentary nation, like the U.S.\nThe emerging U.S. sport policy looks like a mistake that underrepresents nearly all college student-athletes, and instead represents university commercial interests that are often not in the best interests of student-athletes.\nAwhile back I had a conversation with an analyst who worked for the Chicago Cubs. The injury crisis for baseball pitchers was something he worked on directly, overseeing data sharing between the Cubs, the Tampa Bay Rays and a handful of other MLB teams. Those teams hoped that their data collaboration would help the teams’ researchers to solve, or at least improve, the pitching injuries situation. He also told me about a proposal he had made to MLB to fund biomechanics pitching labs for any NCAA school that would be willing to share its biomechanics and injury-related data. (The idea went nowhere.) If one agrees that data sharing is crucial for reducing sports injuries, then U.S. sport policy can reasonably be understood as, at least in part, public health policy.\nA Cubs-like subsidy (sourced to pro sports leagues or to government outlays) could realistically be extended beyond schools with baseball pitchers to any college athlete willing to share their injury-related data, which would be all of their health and performance data. The arrangement would necessitate applied privacy technology (like I work on) to preserve some (though not all) athlete anonymity. At the end of the day the most elite, most valuable athletes would have the most valuable data.\nAthletes could be paid according to their exceptionalism within a framework that works for quarterbacks and for water polo players, for SEC athletes and HBCU athletes and Division III athletes, for men and for women. Any organization seeking financial gain from sport policy related to college student-athletes should expect to offset their benefit in ways that support public health efforts around athletes and injuries.\n\n\nNews\n\nWill Stein has a plan to fix Kentucky’s biggest roster red flag from Wildcat Blue Nation blog by Drew Holbrook on January 19\nIt’s Time to Drop Total Running as a KPI in Football from Hudl blog by Mauro Mandorino on January 15\nA new CEMMT blog with Damian Keter summarizes our mega-mechanisms paper sponsored by ForceNET and published in PLOS One. from X/Twitter by Chad Cook on January 13\nIs it fair that a reliever gets the win after one inning while a starter throws seven scoreless and gets nothing?

    "section": "",
    "text": "Work on developing this newsletter continues. I’m pushing in the direction of something quicker and newsier for 2026. Thanks for reading!\n\nDemand and Capacity\nStructural engineers use Demand-Capacity models to understand risk related to buildings and bridges. Capacity refers to the unit’s strength based on its design and material construction. The external forces that the unit experiences is the Demand. When Capacity is greater than Demand we are safe. Athletes’ Injury Risk models based on Training Load data fail to parse Capacity and Demand, neglecting some really useful descriptive details in the process.\nLet’s look first at Capacity. Capacity closely approximates Training Load as an indicator of athletes’ fitness. A more complete story for Capacity should also include Readiness parameters that come from recovery, stress and sleep biometrics. To go on with the building analogy, Capacity is the design, construction and ongoing maintenance for athletes. Training, injury and return-to-play from injury are Capacity supplements and reductions.\nExamples: Greek researchers showed that even short flights (&lt; 5 hours) deteriorate athletic performance, probably because of lost sleep. Athlete performance consultant Peter Tierney recently posted the benefit of sprint training for athletes, with greater benefit to athletes with high training loads. Whoop posted Christiano Ronaldo’s year-end data summary from the company’s wearable sensing platform.\nDemand refers to all of the external forces that apply in the context of athletic competition. Some of these forces are controllable. Some are not. Changes to a game model or game plan can ask more or ask less of specific players. Weather and play surface can be controlled indoors but are subject to unpredictable factors (temperature, traction) outdoors. A team’s or an athlete’s personal goals for individual performance, recognition or achievement can also apply a psychosocial demand.\nExamples: The British Journal of Sports Medicine published a study led by Tom Allen from Arsenal that calculated changes in running load and fixture congestion for Premier League players since the 2015-16 season. Allen and co-authors cite, “Running load demands (TD, HID, HSR, SprD, HID/min, HSR/min and SprD/min), total match minutes and congested minutes have increased over the last decade.” Professional soccer athletes James Milner and Steph Houghton also collaborated on an essay for BJSM that documents their experience with more running and more games compared to earlier in their careers.\nDemand-Capacity models are, in many cases, instantiated by formulating the Demand-Capacity ratio (DCR). When Demand/Capacity (Demand divided by Capacity) is greater than 1 then it equates to failure in structural engineering situations. Given the relatively rare instances of athletes’ injury, it would be difficult for DCR to predict injury right off the bat so “Injury = Failure” may not be the proper context for an Athletes DCR. A more realistic starting point is to use changes in DCR to describe an athlete’s performance decline in terms of expected or actual values, whether from age or injury or both.\nIt also makes sense to sum the Demand and the Capacity for all of the individual players on a team in order to generate a team-wide DCR. Injury cascades (and other major Capacity changes) and fixture congestion results (and other major Demand changes) would surface with real clarity.\nTeams should also be able to observe positive and negative effects from collaboration and teamwork as teams that work together for easier scores would show lower Demand and lower DCR for the same results. Reports about the recent success of Vanderbilt mens basketball, and its emphasis on unselfish playing style, show the substantial benefit from high levels of players’ cohesion in team sports. At least that is the hypothesis, that better teamwork can reduce individual athletes’ wear and tear.\n\n\nCollege Sports, Sport by Sport Changes\nI went to Northwestern with ESPN’s college sports writer Dan Murphy who profiled Cody Campbell, describing Campbell’s role in evolving the business models so that U.S. college sports can be a long-term sustainable enterprise. Campbell has also played a major part (as chief financial underwriter) for the football team’s success at Texas Tech. The fix for college sports, according to Campbell, is a change to federal law, one that would enable American universities to collectively negotiate their television contracts, something that would increase (potentially dramatically) revenue and return the money to levels where revenue sports (football, basketball) can support non-revenue sports (everything that’s not football, basketball).\nUniversities are not waiting for government intervention to decide their options. The financial and competitive pressure has compelled action, and what has occurred so far is on a sport-by-sport basis.\nCollege hockey has changed noticeably since former Canadian Hockey League (CHL) minor league junior hockey players started joining college teams. High-impact CHL freshman are producing for Maine and Penn State. In general, the deeper talent pool has more good teams and more goal-scoring.\nCollege soccer has moved in the direction of a competitive season with games during both the traditional Fall and Spring academic calendars. According to reporting by Sportico, the move syncs with MLS calendar changes and sets up lots of attention for competitive American soccer in April. The new college soccer schedule is more likely to come to NCAA Mens programs before the NCAA Womens programs.\nCollege swimming looks like it will have a 12-team “College Swimming League” with made-for television dual meets that also count as NCAA competitions.\nCollege basketball recently saw an NBA-drafted player, James Nnaji, gain eligibility to play for Baylor. Nnaji might join the team as soon as this January. There may be more college basketball roster spots available for G-League players and NBA draftees looking for a place to earn a better paycheck. (The NCAA has announced rules clarifications saying that drafted basketball players are ineligible.)\nA note about college athletes and their data privacy Privacy is barely discussed in the conversations about new business models for college sports. As an athletes’ data privacy researcher who has worked in media businesses I can see how privacy is lower priority than business and financial fundamentals. Data privacy is, however, a central aspect of athletes’ basic rights. When discussions turn to asking what’s best for athletes (as opposed to university or business interests) the subject of privacy emerges. In this situation privacy has become a bellwether for identifying (or ignoring) athletes’ interests in discussions about the changes ahead for college sports.\n\n\nYouth Sports Burnout\nA feature-length article by Ken Belson looks at how and why large numbers of child athletes are failing to thrive within their youth sport experiences. Specialization, competition rank high on a long list of anxiety-inducing pressures that coaches, parents and organized youth sports in general combine to inflict on pre-teens and teens. 70 percent of child athletes drop out by age 13. Belson writes that viewing the problems in youth sports through a mental health lens is a path forward. Coping is a mechanism for kids to possibly find the fun that previous generations did not have to look so hard to find in sports.\nWith the 2026 Winter Olympics close to its start, a Wisconsin newspaper asked famous Olympic speed skater Eric Heiden for thoughts about the promising 21-year old U.S. speed skater Jordan Stolz. Heiden is legendary for winning short- and long-distance races, something that young skaters no longer have an opportunity to pursue. Training programs have become specialized for young skaters. Heiden feels that there is a mental advantage that comes from taking on challenges that don’t materialize if it is a singular focus on winning.\nStolz made it through the gauntlet and is on the verge of his Olympic dreams. Most child athletes won’t realize Olympics or professional dreams, which should be obvious. But if two-thirds of athletes don’t reach higher levels of competition then the athlete development pipeline reduces dramatically. Specialization, it seems, has a lot to do with why. “Exceptional young performers reached their peak quickly but narrowly mastered only one interest (e.g., one sport). By contrast, exceptional adults reached peak performance gradually with broader, multidisciplinary practice. However, elite programs are designed to nurture younger talent,” is the finding from a review article published this week in Science.\nEric Cressey is Director of Player Performance for the New York Yankees and a long-time personal trainer for young baseball talents. As described in an essay from earlier this year Cressey saw a unique training window in his young daughter’s rehabilitation for a broken arm. “It’s on us as coaches to a) identify where the massive growth potential exists, b) make the athlete/parents/coach aware of it, and c) close the gap with good programming and quality coaching,” writes Cressey, making points that are at odds with the benefit from increased autonomy mentioned in the Belson article. These windows of “adaption,” according to Cressey, “set the state for more long-term success.” But if these windows come with the dependency on coaches to recognize and program then burnout should surprise no one.\n\n\nMore News\n\nThe effects of stroboscopic vision training on physical performance in athletes: a systematic review BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation journal by Birgul Dingirdan Gultekinler et al. on Dec 19\nPerspectives on sports analytics to inform constraint manipulation, representative learning and functional variability in practice design Human Movement Science journal by Ben Teune et al. on Dec 21\nThe National Science Foundation just had a big reorganization.

    "text": "As I get the newsletter up and running it might take a few weeks to work out a regular production schedule. My goal is to have a regular once per week delivery by Thanksgiving, and then ramp up to twice per week by year end. The amount of available material is substantial, and that is exciting. Eventually, and probably soon, I should have a succinct description for what this newsletter covers and why. The voice will be technically dense, culturally relevant and fun to read. There will also be a website spinning up at https://newsletter.bradstenger.com as the newsletter comes together. I am using the Quarto publishing system and I am excited about the possibilities that the platform offers.\n\nSports, Infectious Disease and Public Health Policy\na smaller CDC puts athletes at risk\nThe number of compromised athletes from illness far exceeded the number of compromised athletes from injury at the most recent Swimming World Championships in Singapore. The cause was a contagious gastroenteritis that came with U.S. swimmers from their training camp in Thailand. Elite athletes normally use 5-star facilities, and before COVID they could normally count on an environment that would not make them sick. COVID changed the rules, and no place, no matter the expense, could assure total confidence.\nConfidence in public health is about to get worse as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shrinks in size and responsibility. Leagues, teams and athletes will probably want to anticipate worst case scenarios, COVID-level precautions, in order to assure athlete health when there is regional, national or international travel for competition, whether that is for games or tournaments or Olympics or World Cups. The potential exposure combined with the high stakes for athletes’ health and performance makes it almost necessary to institute bubble-like preventive measures in order to make it more likely to identify contagious infections sooner and not later. And as public health infrastructure degrades the need increases to step up bubble-type precautions. For example, personal health-monitoring measurements using wearables has been shown to identify infections before symptoms appear.\nHow bad will public health get? It looks like that depends on where you go. Vermont, where I am, looks like it will establish public health monitoring in an alliance with the other New England states. California, Oregon and Washington plan something similar on the West coast. Properly-funded government public infrastructure has an important role in developing monitoring technologies. The wastewater monitoring that helped to corral COVID is set to improve as AI and functional genomics describe real-time risk inherent to changes that occur with mutating pathogenic vectors. Eventually the tech will make it possible to where and why infectious disease risk is high. But that’s not the world we have right now.\n\n\nPersonalized Nutrition\nnutrition is an n=1 experiment\nMore than 80% of student-athletes at the University of Georgia eat at Chipotle at least once per week. The figure is 98% for Ohio State student-athletes. The statistics are part of the announcement that Chipotle now gives student-athletes at Georgia, Ohio State and University of Florida (&gt; 90%) coupons for free food during their sports seasons.\nThere’s a trend among food product developers to target demand among active populations with new offerings. Supplements like creatine, protein and collagen have shown increased effectiveness in active populations where inactive populations do not benefit, coming from Mike Ormsbee in his conversation with podcaster (and restauranteur) David Chang. The same should be true for substantial, relatively unprocessed fast casual burrito bowls.\nUltra-endurance athletes have begun to seize competitive advantages from fueling strategies that make sure energy stores are not depleted. The nutrition programs have become personalized and precise. Continued progress to personalized nutrition will accelerate as the research continues. There’s a good chance that future will look something like Chipotle where my order (burrito: 2x chicken, pinto beans, cheese and lettuce) is what works for me and not necessarily anyone else. The minimally processed, substantial mix of quality proteins and carbohydrates hits at the lowest common denominator of what an athlete needs but there is no single recipe that works for all athletes.\nThe question of how to eat becomes more important than what to eat if it becomes incumbent for each athlete to be their own personalized nutrition expert. A recent Stanford study shows that blood sugar responses to carbohydrate intake is highly variable, and depends on individual health and metabolism. But where subtypes for general pre-diabetic populations can be measured, each and every high-performance athlete might be their own singular subtype.\n\n\nPredicting Athletes’ (Re)Injuries\nexpect regular info on how algorithms and models for injury continue to evolve\nNew research out of Australia took data from one Australian Football League club to model athletes’ re-injury susceptability. The study takes athlete data for 1 season and 1 team, combining injury data for 33 athletes with performance tracking data 2500+ training and competition sessions. The injury prediction model comes from ~100 injuries, meaning that very few sessions had injuries occur, pointing to the obvious benefit from data sharing among teams in order to base results on data with more injuries and more data sets.\nThe work combines survival modeling and a Hidden Markov Model, an approach that tracks a range of known covariates and also incorporates hidden, unknown or unknowable factors but still provides measurable reliability for predictions. Age, it turns out, is the leading covariate factor affecting re-injury. But \"factors relating to the number of efforts exceeding 95%ile in terms of speed, perceived exertion and acceleration had significant affects on risk of re-injury.\"\nThe results are somewhat consistent with a 5000-person study of injured runners that gained attention this summer. Danish researchers used Garmin data for recreational runners and identified 1820 injured athletes. Large spikes in training distances were the most frequent cause of overuse injuries which authors found to occur in 30% of runners who had at least 200 running sessions.\nIn both the elite athlete who is recovering from injury, or the recreational athlete who trains irregularly, it is essential to prepare for maximum effort endeavors."

    "text": "Hope 2026 is off to a great start! This newsletter project is rounding into shape behind the scenes. I’m ready to get your feedback and incorporate any notes you have for ADCN scope and content. Just reply to this email and I should get your note directly. Thanks!\n\nThe Science and The Art of Team Building\nKent Hughes likes his team. He’s the general manager of the Montreal Canadiens, and he told a recent media gaggle that his team’s recent success was “what happens when a team plays for each other.” As evidence, he pointed to a recent article in The Athletic by Rustin Dodd, that asked “How do you hold a star athlete accountable?”\nCoaches have their approaches for player accountability, and results are mixed. Honest confrontational approaches fail as often as they succeed. One example cited by Dodd, a star-coach disagreement involving Memphis Grizzlies’ Ja Morant and coach Tuomas Iisalo where Iisalo called out Morant in front of the team a few weeks ago. Since then Memphis’ season is floundering, five games below .500. Morant looks like he will soon be traded.\nThe more successful approach mentioned in the article is team accountability. “The most effective mode of accountability was not handed down by a manager but instead derived from the emotional connections that employees had for each other,” according to Cornell professor Diedre Snyder. (This is her paper.) “It’s teams that know each other, trust each other, have an emotional connection to each other.” Leaders matters but only to create a culture where players prioritize not letting their teammates down.\nDodd has another recent article that put coaching leadership under a microscope, specifically the leadership style of New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel. Vrabel is an example of a coach who pushes his players outside their comfort zones in an effort to achieve superior performance. Again, the idea is based on science. Paul Zak is a cognitive neuroscience researcher and an expert in leadership, and he feels that effective coaching requires a certain amount of bullying.\n“Our brains are so energy hungry,” Zak tells Dodd. “They’re just such an enormous energy (drain) in the body that we have evolved to kind of cruise most of the time. It’s like, ‘I really don’t want to expend the metabolic energy of doing something cognitively or physically difficult unless I’m really pushed to do that.’ So we need to be pushed. And I’m going to celebrate it when you reach these goals.”\nZak was among the first brain scientists to recognize the significance of oxytocin, a hormone that contributes to feelings of attachment, closeness and trust. Zak also acknowledges that the forces which compel human interaction like appearances and behaviors play critical roles alongside neurobiology. An organization can create settings for neurological bonding but lack the necessary person-to-person interaction, and vice versa. It takes the right mix of personalities throughout a coaching staff and locker room to get culture right.\nWhen we interview student-athletes as part of my research we probe their coach-athlete interactions and we ask every question we can think of when it comes to choosing between personal development and team collaboration. What’s most interesting about their answers is how their young adult thoughts come at a time when their judgements begin to form. The fact that we get thoughtful answers to these questions is, I think, indicative that the push-pull between self-development and team-contribution is an essential aspect of team sports participation. Just like every athlete differs in their physical capabilities, their mental and cognitive approach is also uniquely their own.\nAre you building a team, or a collection of talent? The answer has to be both. The big difference: A collection of talent makes sense on a spreadsheet while a team makes sense in the personal interactions of everyone involved.\n\n\nSports Research Funding, Sports Research Methods\nDavid Spergel oversees science grantmaking at the Simons Foundation and he spoke with a magazine editor about the shifts in US science policy. Research and research funding are intimately connected. Spergel sees two possible futures for science funding in America, “One is that this proposed budget is a bump in the road and funding will stay at close to the same level. A second version is where this represents a real sea change in the relationship between government and science funding. I don’t think we know what world we’re in yet.”\nUniversities have responded to their new reality and have cut back on new hires. Don’t expect to see big new program announcements for sports research at American universities. The last two announcements that I saw come from University of Michigan and University of California-Berkeley. Michigan launched a $25 million research partnership with ASICS, a Japanese shoe and apparel company. Berkeley created the Women’s Health and Performance Initiative led by the school’s Institute for Security and Governance with external partner SPD Sports and internal partners in Athletics, Public Health and Data Science.\nThe agreements give two Asian sports manufacturers access to expertise, lab facilities, teams and athletes. I am not familiar with changing norms in Asian participatory sports but the 2032 Summer Olympics will be in Australia, giving Asian athletes a proximity advantage and increased public attention. The partnership may also signal new (or perhaps improved) recruitment pipelines to elite Asian athletes into the schools’ Olympics and non-Olympics sports.\nAccess to teams has become every bit as important as access to athletes for sports research. The number of research articles in the subject area of “athletic performance” which mention “field-based” methods jumped to 46 for the years 2024 and 2025 from 10 in years 2022 and 2023. Field-based methods are studies which collect data in athletes’ playing and practicing environment, and not in a laboratory (or other tightly controlled setting).\nStellingwerff et al. published a review that is also a how-to for conducting field-based research during training camps and in competition. The authors acknowledge that they sacrifice experimental control and accuracy by taking their study outside the lab, but “development of more portable measurement equipment (e.g., indirect calorimetry, desktop blood/gas analyzers, portable laboratories, etc.) and/or wearable or consumable technologies (e.g., smart watches, sensors, core temp pills, etc.)” make field-based study more compelling.\nThe University of Michigan started the Athlete Innovation Initiative in the Human Performance & Sport Science Center in 2024. This program trains student researchers in new athletic data collection technologies, and connects their expertise to Michigan student-athletes and teams. Before this year of research cutbacks, there had been momentum at major US sports universities to connect relevant research labs to sports teams, including field-based investigations.\nTwo Michigan middle-distance track athletes, Miles Brown and Ian Hill, who both plan to go to medical school describe their experience in a university news article. “A lot of what we were doing was looking at the different sports at the university, especially the sports that would be interested in doing some testing in this lab, and identifying what tests we could do that could be predictive of performance or injury prevention or whatever that sport would want,” said Ian Hill.\nWith change comes uncertainty. Spergel makes the point that there is no way for philanthropy to come close to filling government’s role in funding research. If the government-university research funding relationship is permanently changed, Spergel expects universities to identify and focus on strengths. That assumption fits with all of the changes to the American college sports business model where universities will have to make business decisions that will affect student-athletes.\nMy research funding from National Science Foundation expires at the end of the year. I hope that there is a path forward for research like mine, on privacy and athletes’ data. I’m not exactly sure where to look for it. The student-athletes we talk to generally approve of sharing data for research but it always exists in the context of a player-team dynamic. There’s opportunity for expanding field-based research and for connecting it to lab-based work.\nHelp Me to Follow the Money   I’ll do my best to report the announcements for sports research initiatives that occur in North America. If you hear things, please let me know.

Thanks!\n\nAthlete Development: Baseball and Every Other Sport\nProspects alert! It’s almost time to begin playing professional baseball. Advances in baseball player development have made college and pro baseball compelling in a way that’s far different from five or ten years ago. The Moneyball foundation of homeruns and strikeouts still defines the modern baseball product and is still monotonous. The good pitchers keep getting injured, which is a problem. But new faces and the dramatic improvement in player skill and performance are eye-opening. It’s an innovation story and who doesn’t like an innovation story.\n\n\n\nJosh Hejka answers a question at the Wake Forest baseball seminar in December, 2025.\n\n\nJosh Hejka made the point during a panel at the 2025 Wake Forest Player Development Seminar that the majority of MLB baseball players have reached that level on talent alone. Their development trajectory is just beginning and some percentage will flourish with access to elite biomechanics training programs. So this might be the best part of the season, when you get to see bold! predictions on this year’s new faces in MLB. You can read Eno Sarris’ giant report on Stuff+ pitcher rankings (which also includes a functional health and sustainability assessment, meant for fantasy baseball but super-interesting nonetheless).\nThe innovation story around athlete development is big in baseball, but it hits every sport. You can see it in football and quarterback development is central to this year’s Super Bowl. The path to the big game has been different for the Patriots’ Drake Maye and the Seahawks’ Sam Darnold. This article in The Ringer describes how each teams’ offensive coordinator helped their quarterback’s decision-making. There are two ways for a quarterback to read the situation during a passing play.\nA quarterback can pre-process the situation if he knows the limitations of the defensive alignment. But football teams have gotten better at disguising defenses and an alternative method for quarterbacking emerged. The quarterback should instead progress from one option, Plan A, to the next, Plan B, and so on. A progression is an easier cognitive problem for a quarterback and with good play design produces winning results. It’s still possible though for smart operators at quarterback and at game planning to get their desired results through preprocessing. The Seahawks are the progression team. The Patriots are the preprocessing team. One team will win Super Bowl LX.\nI plan to tell more innovation and player development stories for basketball, hockey and soccer, and for college sports in the ADCN. Athlete development is, in many ways, the demand side for athletes’ health and performance data. The supply side is not just the athletes. It’s the technologies to collect and manages the data that inform athlete development. Some of my research into privacy and athletes’ data is precautionary. If I do it well, some of my the work will head off problems that might otherwise slow down the innovation around athlete development. I will be telling those stories in the ADCN too.\n\n\nData Sharing in Sports: Some of the How and Why\nThe soccer data site FBref no longer has access to the a rich data pipeline provided to it by Opta and StatsPerform. FBref had been considered to be the most comprehensive no-cost public football data resource before the change. The loss creates a void in the soccer analytics community and a major drop in the data resources for global women’s soccer.\nThis comes at a time when the NFL’s 2026 Big Data Bowl nears its conclusion. Michael Lopez, the Senior Director of Football Data and Analytics, told the Wharton Moneyball podcast that data is a football Field of Dreams, “If you have the data and make it available, they will analyze it.” Data availability is an opportunity for innovation and for community. According to Lopez, the competition and the data availability has strong support from the league and its member teams. The Big Data Bowl also benefits from a complimentary data set that is robust and no cost at nflfastr (accessible using R and Python).\nMajor League Baseball has its Statcast pitch-by-pitch data service. This incredible resource made it possible for Connor Moore to use machine learning and biomechanics to reverse engineer pitcher health from the velocity, location and pitch type of their throws. The work earned Moore his PhD at Clemson University.\nI used to manage the APIs at The New York Times and we had strong support for making its content data free and accessible. These were tools that the company’s developers could use to help create new products. More important was the participation that the free API generated in the college student hackathon community. The cost was small compared to the benefit. The same appears to be true for the NFL.\nOpta and Stats Perform have data services as their main business. (I interned at Stats during grad school.) A data business may not have the public mission of a prestigous news organization or a sports league, and probably needs to enlist a benefactor in order to provide data services that will enable free distribution. There is a decent chance that at some point FIFA or another global soccer operator will restore some kind free data access.\nOr it won’t. There does not appear to be any public component to NBA player tracking or biomechanics data. NHL shot and lineup data is available at MoneyPuck but the advanced player tracking data the the NHL uses for its Edge stats and information site. Corey Sznajder maintains a hockey microstats data service at allthreezones.com, something that invites comparison to Baseball Savant and Statcast, which started as a personal data project before MLB took it over.\nSharing data and making money, business makes it so the two go together, but sometimes it’s not an easy fit. Innovations in technology, in computing, in human performance create opportunities for new business models. New ways to do both, share data and make money, will surface as athletes’ data supply and demand continue to evolve. No doubt it is a big help for innovators and entrepreneurs to have access to quality sports data resources at no cost.\n\n\nNews\n\n‘All It Is Is Pain’: The Olympian Testing the Limits of Endurance in The New York Times Magazine by Reid Forgrave on February 5, 2026\nMetadata, data documentation, and provenance … the latest in my Better Code, Better Science series. in Bluesky by Russ Poldrack on February 3, 2026\nMichigan just reported a record $67.6 million in football ticket sales for 2024-25 in Bluesky by Lev Akabas on February 2, 2026\nThe Future of Biometrics in Formula 1 Racing in NYU Journal of Intellectual Property & Entertainment Law by Eleanor Schifino on January 27, 2026\nWhy are Real Madrid players wearing masks in training? in The Athletic by Mario Cortegna on February 5, 2026\nHow college sports juiced Olympic development in NPR, Planet Money by Wailin Wong, Adrian Ma, Corey Bridges, Kate Concannon on February 5, 2026"
