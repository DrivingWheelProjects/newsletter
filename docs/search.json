    "title": "ADCN: A sports science and technology newsletter by Brad Stenger",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to my resurrected sports science and technology newsletter. I've given it a title, the \"Athletes Data Community Newsletter,\" something that reflects my research interests.\nI'm going into my last year of a Computer Science PhD at the University of Vermont and my primary research projects focus on privacy aspects of athletes’ health and performance data. Other papers in preparation: task analysis for athletes' data technologies based on field-based research, athletes' injury risk from an engineering systems perspective, socio-technical impediments and solutions for data sharing in sports. By putting athletes' data front and center I think that it will be possible to discuss the varied aspects of how data gets collected, managed and applied across the full spectrum of sports. At least I hope so.\n\nConcussions in 2025\nflashing smart mouthguards and the growing importance of injury risk awareness\nFootball season is concussion season, according to CNN. Fortunately research in traumatic brain injury continues to advance. A U.S. research team led by a Milwaukee team from St. Luke's Medical Center and Medical College of Wisconsin observed that 75% of football players experienced fewer head impact exposure after return to play. Longer post-concussion recovery led to larger decreases in head impact exposures. Conservative return-to-play management from concussion likely increases athletes' awareness of head impacts and improves their ability to protect themselves.\nAwareness is central to a smart impact-sensing mouthguard with a bright red light that flashes above threshold acceleration values (75g for men, 65g for women, or 4500 radians per second squared). Years ago, research biomedical engineer Eric Nauman (then at Purdue, now at University of Cincinnati) told me that football helmets should have plastic shells that would crack at similar thresholds, and prompt the same response: Get that athlete off the field. The evidence is the urgency, and without both, the decision-making circumstance changes.\nAn athlete, a coach or a referee can all choose to play on without a clear and obivious signal that it is irresponsible to continue. \"Where athletes really get themselves into trouble – they continue to play. They get another, even minor, hit, and the symptoms get even more amplified,\" says Marie Schaefer of Cleveland Clinic. Technology that improves injury risk awareness and accounting is potentially disruptive, but only if norms in sport prioritize risk awareness. The alternative is to attribute sports injury to bad luck and believe that athletes inevitably get hurt.\n\n\nSynthetic Data in Sports\nsynthetic data is important technology for sports at the junction of data science, data sharing and privacy\nPrivacy and data sharing in sports, this is my research in the PhD program at the University of Vermont. Questions about privacy for athletes' health and performance data have largely been unasked, and unanswered. So I am trying to ask them. Expect to see lots more about these subjects in the weeks ahead.\nSynthetic data, it turns out, is a crucial aspect of my research. Synthetic data, data that is produced algorithmically as opposed to being observed or collected, is capable of guaranteeing both privacy and quality and lends itself to widespread sharing. Examples of sports-related synthetic data are just proof of concept at this point. A study out of Ireland uses synthetic data to predict gait stability in an older population. The context is more sports-adjacent than actual sports but the work is a stepping stone to more complex biomechanical movements and more diverse athletic populations. Earlier this summer John Warmenhoven derived a synthetic dataset that showed only numerical acute training load, numerical chronic training load (4-week) and a binary injury data point, all expressed on a per week basis. The paper is a simple how-to and little more, \"an important first step toward better understanding of the utility of synthetic data for the sports and exercise sciences more broadly,\" the authors write.\n\n\nHidden Danger of Gambling\nathletes' performance data is essential information for sports gamblers who seek to create a betting edge based on predictions of players' health, performance and injury\nA lawsuit is working its way through UK courts. A group of Premier League players has sued via \"stop processing\" requests in order to rein in the access that commercial operators have to player performance data. Commercial operators consist of broadcasters, game developers and gambling companies, and they have negotiated data access rights with sports leagues under collective bargaining positions that those leagues have established with its players. Information fuels the analysis of high stakes sports gambling, and no one has higher stakes that the firms that take sports bets. Profiting from sports gambling depends on maintaining an edge that can tilt odds in ways that other bettors cannot expect. The amount of player performance data that is needed to create an edge is substantial, making it somewhat unrealistic at present. The payoff that will come from developing the edge is substantial however.\nHenry Abbott makes the point in a researched essay that team-wide health and stamina are deciding NBA games, displacing some of the importance that star-level talent has in teams' game models.\nLonger-term, performance data has a significant role to play in the personalized care and training that elite athletes increasingly require, according to the Danish authors of Consensus Statement-Optimizing Performance of the Elite Athlete, recently published in the Scandanavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports. The authors write, “Technological innovations are likely to enable the development of personalized training and nutrition strategies in the next decades through emerging technologies. … These innovations may allow for better tailoring of training and nutrition strategies across the varying demands of training and competition.\nAs the personalization advances, analysis of athletes' data should also provide clearer pictures for injury prevention and injury prediction. Nothing about the future of sports scares me more than sports gamblers inventing and then using an edge based on athlete injury prediction."

    "text": "As I get the newsletter up and running it might take a few weeks to work out a regular production schedule. My goal is to have a regular once per week delivery by Thanksgiving, and then ramp up to twice per week by year end. The amount of available material is substantial, and that is exciting. Eventually, and probably soon, I should have a succinct description for what this newsletter covers and why. The voice will be technically dense, culturally relevant and fun to read. There will also be a website spinning up at https://newsletter.bradstenger.com as the newsletter comes together. I am using the Quarto publishing system and I am excited about the possibilities that the platform offers.\n\nSports, Infectious Disease and Public Health Policy\na smaller CDC puts athletes at risk\nThe number of compromised athletes from illness far exceeded the number of compromised athletes from injury at the most recent Swimming World Championships in Singapore. The cause was a contagious gastroenteritis that came with U.S. swimmers from their training camp in Thailand. Elite athletes normally use 5-star facilities, and before COVID they could normally count on an environment that would not make them sick. COVID changed the rules, and no place, no matter the expense, could assure total confidence.\nConfidence in public health is about to get worse as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shrinks in size and responsibility. Leagues, teams and athletes will probably want to anticipate worst case scenarios, COVID-level precautions, in order to assure athlete health when there is regional, national or international travel for competition, whether that is for games or tournaments or Olympics or World Cups. The potential exposure combined with the high stakes for athletes’ health and performance makes it almost necessary to institute bubble-like preventive measures in order to make it more likely to identify contagious infections sooner and not later. And as public health infrastructure degrades the need increases to step up bubble-type precautions. For example, personal health-monitoring measurements using wearables has been shown to identify infections before symptoms appear.\nHow bad will public health get? It looks like that depends on where you go. Vermont, where I am, looks like it will establish public health monitoring in an alliance with the other New England states. California, Oregon and Washington plan something similar on the West coast. Properly-funded government public infrastructure has an important role in developing monitoring technologies. The wastewater monitoring that helped to corral COVID is set to improve as AI and functional genomics describe real-time risk inherent to changes that occur with mutating pathogenic vectors. Eventually the tech will make it possible to where and why infectious disease risk is high. But that’s not the world we have right now.\n\n\nPersonalized Nutrition\nnutrition is an n=1 experiment\nMore than 80% of student-athletes at the University of Georgia eat at Chipotle at least once per week. The figure is 98% for Ohio State student-athletes. The statistics are part of the announcement that Chipotle now gives student-athletes at Georgia, Ohio State and University of Florida (&gt; 90%) coupons for free food during their sports seasons.\nThere’s a trend among food product developers to target demand among active populations with new offerings. Supplements like creatine, protein and collagen have shown increased effectiveness in active populations where inactive populations do not benefit, coming from Mike Ormsbee in his conversation with podcaster (and restauranteur) David Chang. The same should be true for substantial, relatively unprocessed fast casual burrito bowls.\nUltra-endurance athletes have begun to seize competitive advantages from fueling strategies that make sure energy stores are not depleted. The nutrition programs have become personalized and precise. Continued progress to personalized nutrition will accelerate as the research continues. There’s a good chance that future will look something like Chipotle where my order (burrito: 2x chicken, pinto beans, cheese and lettuce) is what works for me and not necessarily anyone else. The minimally processed, substantial mix of quality proteins and carbohydrates hits at the lowest common denominator of what an athlete needs but there is no single recipe that works for all athletes.\nThe question of how to eat becomes more important than what to eat if it becomes incumbent for each athlete to be their own personalized nutrition expert. A recent Stanford study shows that blood sugar responses to carbohydrate intake is highly variable, and depends on individual health and metabolism. But where subtypes for general pre-diabetic populations can be measured, each and every high-performance athlete might be their own singular subtype.\n\n\nPredicting Athletes’ (Re)Injuries\nexpect regular info on how algorithms and models for injury continue to evolve\nNew research out of Australia took data from one Australian Football League club to model athletes’ re-injury susceptability. The study takes athlete data for 1 season and 1 team, combining injury data for 33 athletes with performance tracking data 2500+ training and competition sessions. The injury prediction model comes from ~100 injuries, meaning that very few sessions had injuries occur, pointing to the obvious benefit from data sharing among teams in order to base results on data with more injuries and more data sets.\nThe work combines survival modeling and a Hidden Markov Model, an approach that tracks a range of known covariates and also incorporates hidden, unknown or unknowable factors but still provides measurable reliability for predictions. Age, it turns out, is the leading covariate factor affecting re-injury. But \"factors relating to the number of efforts exceeding 95%ile in terms of speed, perceived exertion and acceleration had significant affects on risk of re-injury.\"\nThe results are somewhat consistent with a 5000-person study of injured runners that gained attention this summer. Danish researchers used Garmin data for recreational runners and identified 1820 injured athletes. Large spikes in training distances were the most frequent cause of overuse injuries which authors found to occur in 30% of runners who had at least 200 running sessions.\nIn both the elite athlete who is recovering from injury, or the recreational athlete who trains irregularly, it is essential to prepare for maximum effort endeavors."

    "title": "ADCN: Journaling, Stacks vs. Open, Big Data Bowl",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Bumps in the road to regular newsletter production. I think that there will progress toward a weekly ADCN newsletter between now and the end of the year. Once I achieve some consistency I should be able to end the “soft” launch phase that we need to work through. PhD research is, in its way, a content pipeline. The key to regular newsletter production will be wrestling the PhD content pipeline into something readable. Thanks for your patience.\n\nJournaling with Wearables\n“Expert in yourself” is not yet a norm but among high achievers in business and sports it is headed that way. Type A personalities drive the connection between data and habits since the technology is not quite easy enough to use. Call this stuff more of a really-want-to than a need-to at this point but the utility (and probably usability too) increasing dramatically as the benefit to cost ratio increases in the near future. Read on for why the big benefits are coming, and for why personal privacy is a factor.\nHabits are personal behaviors. They defy universal generalization but there is an emerging consensus that gaining some habits (like gym-going) are harder and gaining other habits (like hand-washing) are easier. Self-awareness about what’s healthy, productive, or both healthy and productive, might be the shortest path for someone trying to make a habit out of good habits. Atomic Habits, as put forward by author James Clear, is less a personal guide to habit-formation than it is a guide to self- and environmental-awareness so that you can give yourself the best chance to succeed at habit change.\nHigh achievers often execute on a long development arc. It is not just talent, there is also an endurance factor where sustained improvement progresses year-over-year, sometimes decade-over-decade. No short cuts. Work life incorporates personal habits and self-expertise. Overall, self-knowledge takes guesswork out of finding effective collaborators and, when there is no collaboration, self-fulfillment plugs any gaps with still more self-development productivity.\nA constraints-led approach (CLA) to training is learning methodology that attempts to expedite high-level skill development by imposing constraints. The thoughtful design of the constraints comes from a coach or trainer who knows CLA and perception-action coupling, a kind of meta-cognition where sensemaking in a realistic and constrained training scenario informs future behavior. It’s a higher-order habit meant to create situational preparedness in high-pressure, complex, future settings.\nWhat if you just want to eat less bacon, or improve sleep hygiene? Garmin recently added a “Life Logging” feature to many of the company’s recent edition sport watches. The feature matches a popular aspect of Whoop biometric-tracking bracelets. The on-screen reminders delivered to your watch attach information to a wide range of daily (the typical time interval) wellness observables. The lightweight interaction is a straightforward way to connect behavior to performance when the goal is to change both of those things. Reporting by The New York Times suggests that high-performing business executives are doing something like this with Oura rings.\nResearch technologies are coming that will reduce the cognitive overhead for tracking and adopting habits. Northwestern researchers combine 2 wearables (wrist + necklace), 1 body camera, and a phone app to thoroughly document research subjects’ eating habits. The system gets high-fidelity gesture data from the wearables, and the body camera also recognizes activity signatures that are unique to eating. The product of this research is an effective diagnostic, showing that overeating takes multiple forms and the patterns have emotional, behavioral and contextual dimensions. Work continues, and the hope is for clinicians to use these same tools for personalization and support to enable habit changes.\nMyFoodRepo is a picture-based meal-tracking app developed by Marcel Salathe and his team at EPFL in Switzerland. The researchers combined their meal tracking with ongoing checks of microbe populations in subject microbiomes. Gut health (specifically, gut diversity), they found, depends on how consistently a person eats well, and not just on what a person’s nutrition intake is like. Habits are central to basic body function.\nPrivacy protection is crucial given the personal aspects of habits. That becomes more true as the stakes elevate for good habits and personal health. Athletes are going to experience higher stakes when habits go under a microscope based on the public nature of sports performance. Understanding habit formation needs to go hand in hand with understanding how to keep that information private.\n\n\nStacks vs. Open, Why Choose?\nHudl recently described a research meeting between the company and Mexican university researchers on the company blog. Hudl is among the first sports technology companies to deliver a software “stack.” Software stacks go back the 2000s when most every dynamic website ran on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql, Perl/Php/Python). The essential pieces for a sports infrastructure stack are: 1. athletes’ data collection, 2. athletes’ data management, 3. athletes’ data analysis, and 4. athletes’ data reporting. The integration of the pieces, done as seamlessly as possible, make for a stack and make that stack a more useful product than any of the singular pieces by themselves. Teamworks is the other company that makes a sports stack for teams to buy.\nThe risk to a team who buys a stack is lock-in, a combination of dependence on and reluctance to leave a technology platform. Lock-in, according to technology journalist and activist Cory Doctorow, is the first step to enshittification (platform decay) which occurs when companies with lots of dependent customers prioritize exerting control over customers, instead of delivering value to customers.\nThe LAMP stack was (still is) Open Source technology, which effectively steered it away from enshittification. Open Source (and the related Open Data) is a way to prioritize customer value over long term time windows. The Open Source software model demonstrated by LAMP also scaled well, supporting the explosive growth that the Internet experienced as it got its legs during the early 21st Century. Calls for Open methods and shared infrastructure and practices like this by Garret Bullock and this by Natalie Kupperman promote the awareness and benefits of community stakeholding.\nResearch participation is different in closed and in open platforms. How? Social media data (Facebook, Twitter) used to be widely available and no-cost. Companies met the demand from researchers and developers with APIs. Years ago I wrote about how the APIs to customize sports software was not being demanded or created, and I am not sure how much progress has been made in the time since. End-user programming, as I wrote, is the bottom-up expression of demand for Open infrastructure and data. At present, Open research in sports exists, but not at scales large enough to be useful.\nTop-down progress does not necessarily lead to enshittification. Bottom-up progress does not necessarily gain traction to reach broad-based utility. The need is for some optimizaton of both, top-down and bottom-up, to create a check and balance that guarantees customer value from their sports software.\n\n\nBig Data Bowl 2026\nThe NFL announced the criteria for its 2026 Big Data Bowl (BDB), the annual competition where anyone can take real NFL game data and then answer important (to the NFL at least) research questions. Submissions are judged and cash prizes are given. The combination of real-world data and the accessibility of the Kaggle coding competitions platform makes BDB something far less intimidating than you might expect. There is an engaged community (that includes the NFL researchers who put forward the competition research questions and data set) and the nature of the competition is easy enough to understand and not so cutthroat. The NFL wants to gain deeper insight from the location-tracking data that wearable sensors measure for each player on the field, at a rate of 10 frames per second (in the Kaggle competition data set).\nThe BDB competition has one data set and two tracks. The data set is player movement tracking data for NFL passing plays leading up to the moment that the forward pass is thrown. The task, and the goal of one competition track, is to predict the ongoing player movement as the football moves through the air. The second competition track is to formulate a metric (or, short of that, a video commentary) that describes some aspect of player movement that is accessible to football professionals (like coaches) and football fans (like most Americans).\nThe corpus of relevant research and analysis tools did not take long to assemble: 1. 2023 CMSAC workshop video 2. Kovalchik, Player Tracking Data in Sports 3. sportyR 4. NFLverse 5. NFLfastr 6. Get started with nflfastR 7. A Bayesian circular mixed-effects model for explaining variability in directional movement in American football 8. NFL Ghosts: A framework for evaluating defender positioning with conditional density estimation 9. Ron Yurko’s Thoughts on Big Data Bowl 2025 10. Survival Analysis on Progress after Caught 11. Modeling with Transformers 12. NFL Advanced Stats: How To Use Them and What They Mean\nThe 2026 BDB competition is a step in the direction of integrating athlete biomechanics into game analysis. That’s what Luke Camarao and I have in mind for our submission. If it goes well and we have useful prediction and analytics algorithms for player movement during NFL pass plays then I might also have a starting point to generate synthetic data, something where I can apply and test different amounts of noise to the contest data and then see how the added noise affects player movement predictions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a lengthy rundown on women athletes’ health and performance research. The news peg for it is the announcement of a new University of Indiana initiative, which gave me a chance to look at the bigger picture. Short answer, it’s in a much better place than it was in five or ten years ago. And there is a good chance that it could snowball, as the research raises more questions and technology advances new ways to answer those questions. You, the readers, can expect overviews like this as opportunities to come up to speed on crucial subjects materialize. I thank you for your attention.\n\nIndiana University Female Sports Performance and Research Initiative\nand a rundown of women athletes research\nIndiana University recently announced a women athletes research initiative in partnership with Indiana Sports Corp and Pacers Sports & Entertainment. No dollar or grant-specific information was forthcoming but the program’s research committee co-chair, Katie Siek, is a revealing choice. Siek is professor of informatics and a human- and health-centered computer scientist. (The other co-chair of the research committee is Avinash Chandran, whose work is also discussed in this newsletter.) “Our whole goal here is to actually collect that data and help create interactive systems so that athletes can get better information to improve their health, and the health care system can better provide support for them,” Siek told the Indianapolis Record news organization.\nSports research has been gaining currency in the computing research community that focuses on human-centered computing and human-computer interaction. After a major conference workshop in 2024 sports researchers in the community published Grand Challenges in SportsHCI which stated that “we believe in the benefit of generating fundamental knowledge for SportsHCI more broadly to advance the field as a whole. To achieve this, we aim to identify the grand challenges in SportsHCI, which can help researchers and practitioners in developing a future research agenda.” University of Florida researchers published follow-up work last spring, Coach, Data Analyst, and Protector: Exploring Data Practices of Collegiate Coaching Staff that enlisted coaches for focus groups and found that “coaching staff selectively use data with the goal of balancing performance goals, athlete emotional well-being, and privacy.” Siek has studied prototypes of DaVinci Wearables’ technology that tracks female athlete physiology through biometrics (body temperature, galvanic skin response, body composition, cycle tracking) and assists athletes in reaching performance goals.\nA sports research initiative based on computing is a new kind of interdisciplinary hub for this work. The Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance based primarily at Stanford University is broadly based in medical and life science. The University of Michigan Human Performance & Sport Science Center resides in the School of Kinesiology. The FIFA Women’s Football Development Programme takes a soccer-centric approach. The International Olympic Committee has created the Female, woman, and girl Athlete Injury pRevention (FAIR) consensus.\nPapers, conferences and spinouts are a good indicator for when a research initiative has hit critical mass and has impact. The FIFA Women’s group has a set of papers, many attempting to define benchmarks for elite women athletes, covering injury events and recovery parameters (links). The FAIR consensus has also produced a series of expert reviews on gender affects and prevention strategies for sport-related injury. The group also recently held the Female, Woman, and Girl Athlete Health and Safety Summit at the University of Calgary. The sixth editon of the Female Athlete Conference took place last spring in Boston and conference founder Kate Ackerman is the director of the new Women’s Health, Sports & Performance Institute, a translational sports medicine research center outside Boston. Stanford and Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance will host its inaugural Female Athlete Research Meeting (FARM) in November.\n\n\nBayesian Injury Rate Estimation\na shift is underway from “frequentist” to “Bayesian” injury surveillance analysis\nA couple of recent papers by Avinash Chandran announce a shift in the way that the NCAA does injury surveillance. Chandran describes the change as moving from a “frequentist” approach to a Bayesian approach in two papers: The Practical Value of Bayesian Inference in Describing the Epidemiology of Sports Injuries from Sports Medicine journal, and Bayesian methods for estimating injury rates in sport injury epidemiology from Injury Epidemiology journal. Chandran is the injury epidemiologist in charge of the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program for the Datalys Center, a non-profit collaborative research organization originally founded by the NCAA and the American College of Sports Medicine.\nThe difference between frequentist and Bayesian is almost as stark as analysis before and after the emergence of data science. Frequentist approaches center on counts and the traditional practice of statistical hypothesis tests, statistical significance and p-values. Bayesian approaches, in general, can take any and all prior information and then use that information to calculate posterior probabilities for the likelihood of statistical events. The frequentist approach is what it is, while the Bayesian approach iterates and evolves as meaningful prior information is applied. The change is a crucial progress step for injury surveillance and, potentially, for the NCAA.\nWhy you ask? Injury surveillance has its benchmark measurement, called injury rate, which in frequentist terms is the number of injury occurrences divided by the number of injury exposures. Chandran’s workflow for an injury rate Bayesian model looks like this. \nNew information that will improve injury rate calculation are coming. Biometric, biomechanical and biomarker information now present a more in-depth picture of athletes’ ongoing physiology along with essential recovery and fatigue details. The rate-limiting step probably is not going to be the lag in completing the studies to merge the new information. More likely the greater lag will come from organizing the athletes’ data into coherent pathways for causal analysis of athletes’ injuries that can make the sum of all the investigations greater than its parts. The NCAA and its Sports Science Institute could champion the effort, and so could the federal government if it decides to play a role in managing college sports. Professional sports leagues could also provide a guiding hand, and as a result become a major beneficiary of the research.\n\n\nHot Hand and Talent Evaluation\nextending the Hot Hand Fallacy to front office decision-making\nThe hot-hand fallacy has been a talking point since Amos Tversky and colleagues first identified the hot-hand in the 1980s.\nThe idea is simple. Recent success increases the likelihood of future success. The classic case, the one Tversky identified, is the basketball player who makes a few shots in a row, prompting both the player and teammates to expect the next shot to go in as well. The premise has been rebutted and amended by psychologists, economists and statisticians seeking ground truth for what is more accurately called a heuristic. That heuristic is often (but not always) a source of bad decisions and bad outcomes. A couple of recent articles prompted me to ask if the front office decision-making is as prone to hot-handedness as the players on the court, ice, pitch or field.\n“The relationship between cash and winning in the NFL is complicated,” Mike Sando writes at the start of his September 12 article at The Athletic, Ranking NFL teams by spending: The boldest, most frugal and best bang for the buck. Front offices make personnel decisions with varying degrees of confidence and uncertainty. No organization gets every transaction right. But string together personnel wins, whether by draft, trade or free agency and it shows up as wins on the field. To believe that an organization’s decision process is more sound than lucky is to play the hot hand. When that happens the team-wide regression to the mean is imminent.\nSome singular moves can turn out bo be force multipliers according to Sando’s analysis. The Chiefs pay less than market value for an All-World quarterback. The Rams have a superior coach known to do more with less. Some teams have a philosophy that raises their floor. The Eagles always choose to spend money on talent when given the opportunity. The Steelers spend lots more on defense than on offense.\n“When one contention window closes, another one opens,” Dom Luszczyszyn and Scott Wheeler write at the start of their September 17 article, also at The Athletic, The NHL Contention Cycle: Where does each team stand going into 2025-26 and in the future? Like the NFL, teams are all over the place with some rising and others falling. The regression to the mean among NHL hockey teams is maybe more random, and therefore more unavoidable, than NFL football teams if you agree that title contention is cyclical.\nLiverpool has held on to its elite position in the Premiere League despite significant squad turnover. This last article, originally from OneFootball’s Anfield Index blog, describes how the team’s sports science and medical department play a crucial role in talent evaluation. The athletes’ health and performance information was part of the team’s big-money decisions to extend Mohammad Sala’s contract (despite his advanced age) and to acquire Alexander Isak (despite his injury concerns). Another article, again by The Athletic, provides an in-depth analysis of Liverpool’s summer transfer ins and outs. Hidden in the details is how Will Spearman, director of research, championed the signing of Hugo Ekitike, comparing his age-grade statistics to Haaland and Mbappe. If there is an overarching philosophy, Liverpool shows a strong desire to stay young, “Every player Liverpool signed, with the exception of backup goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, is aged 25 or under.” Has the squad’s front office operators raised the team’s floor, or is the inevitable regression to the mean coming? Liverpool’s season is off to a fantastic start but it’s a long season ahead."

    "text": "The ADCN newsletter archive can be found at https://newsletter.bradstenger.com. I mention it here for two reasons. First, the site construction needs some attention and some work, and this public announcement will make it more likely to see those improvements occur sooner rather than later. Second, the website has a sign up where anyone can give their email to join ADCN’s mailing list. I’m still soft-launching ADCN but the public launch is coming. Getting the ADCN web presence up and running is a crucial step.\n\nAlgorithms’ LCD Problem\nPersonalization algorithms, in general, do not work so well when those algorithms have to serve thousands (or millions) of users. The situation is a classic case where usability has to function at a lowest common denominator across a population where the variation is substantial.\nFor some people, especially people who trust machine instructions with little or no question, and in terms of demographics this population skews young, there is also an inabilitiy to contextualize recommendations that come from an AI source. Failing to understand AI in context makes human error likely despite confidence that is out of proportion with reality, mostly because reality gets ignored.\nEvery once in a while the scientific literature presents a window into health data recommendation systems and its lowest common denominator. Apple recently published in PLOS One results from the company’s sleep tracking study that took data from more than 35,000 Apple watch wearers who use the device as a sleep tracker. Most sleep data collection occurs in 1-14 day windows, predominantly at the low end, and it under-estimates the night to night sleep variability across populations. Apple simulated longer duration datasets and subsampled that data in an attempt to understand the depth of the problem with short-duration sleep samples.\nApple researchers stratified groups into one-hour intervals, and came to realize that the smaller group of lighter sleepers (6 +/- 1 hours) could not be differentiated from the more common 7 +/- 1 hour sleepers. “For the planning of future [sleep measurement] studies, there may be a resource and/or participant burden tension between sample size and duration of tracking,” the author conclude, saying “the path to mitigation lies in duration of tracking per participant, more so than boosting cohort sample size.”\nSleep is incredibly complex. Recent mouse studies suggest close links between seasonal variation in diet and circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm may need to be measured for long (probably very long) duration in order to understand seasonal, annual, reproductive, and human life stage variations in sleep, and in turn, recovery and performance. These are evolutionary forces at work where subtle and deep-seated adaptions have major, meaningful implications. Human physiological and cognitive adaptions for running and cooking helped to shape human existence over long term time frames. Is socialized, high exertion, inter-personal competition, also known as sports, fundamentally human and a generator of physiological and cognitive adaption? I wouldn’t rule it out.\nSo what is AI good for when it comes to health and performance data? Arjun Mahajan and Stephen Gilbert gave their opinion in a Nature Digital Medicine essay, “Do we need AI guardians to protect us from health information overload?” Guardians are necessary, they write, because commercial health data devices send too many low-value alerts that miss what a health assistant should target, which are “filtering, contextualizing, and personalizing health information” for users.\nThreshold values in biometric data are a consistently useful interaction that the authors mention, and they do best when the data user specifies the target threshold (like heart rate during zone training). User-specified targets are personalized, contextualized, and filtered, all because a human sets all of those parameters when they go about creating the target alert on their device. Keeping a human in the feedback seems far more useful than a completely automated AI when it comes to data-backed health and performance information.\nSports have coaches. If path to personalization benefits from human input then there should be a place for coaches’ input on behalf of athletes, especially when it comes to determining useful athletes’ thresholds. Putting a coach (or coaches) in the feedback loop should help to avoid low-value alerts and to keep things personal, contextual and filtered. Problems will arise when misaligned incentives prompt coaches to not prioritize athletes’ best interests. In general athletes trust coaches. Give coaches the benefit of the doubt and to make their input for athlete threshold settings a default (or a low-effort optional setting), at least to start.\nHow things start might not be how things end up. There are signs that AI recommendation systems can and will be gamed by a servcice’s self-interests, and not in users’ best interests. A post at Bruce Schneier’s blog describes the phenomena of AI Summary Optimization. The situation is analogous to Search Engine Optimization from 10-15 years ago. AISO is the new SEO. Keywords and content sequences, often jargon, factor into the subjective assessment made by an AI recommender system. Start down the path from automated threshold notification to subjective recommendations and from there it is a slippery slope to low-value alerts.\n\n\nDuty of Care for Data\nThe FAIR consensus reports are a series of review papers that examine “prevention strategies and modifiable risk factors” for female, woman and girl athletes. The papers have been appearing regularly in the British Journal of Sports Medicine and cover their review process and the targets for injury prevention such as concussion, upper extremities, lower extremities, etc. The series recently concluded with articles and essays that discuss dissemination and implementation of FAIR findings and recommendations. The challenge of translating medicine and transferring technology from research to practice is difficult on its easiest day. Any how-to guide will still have difficulty leading interested stakeholders to successful outcomes. Competence and its polar opposite, negligence, are difficult to identify during research translation, and without identifiable best and worst practices, the road map to a better place (or away from a worse place) is not clear or obvious.\nIf there is one guiding principal for athletes’ health it is the idea of duty of care. Duty of care is a legal standard and a social norm and, in general, reflects an individual’s responsibility for the well-being of others. Duty of care means that coaches do not overwork players, that one player does not cheap shot another player, that equipment is safe, that medical staff are available, and any other measure to prevent forseeable harm. Duty of care is also a legal standard, and when breached can result in judgements of negligence and liability.\nDuty of care does not as yet extend to athletes’ data and information, either in its legal or social context. But maybe it should. Duty of care already exists in the context of injury prevention. Greater awareness of its potential application to athletes’ data and information would incentivize action to translate research into practice.\nAnother recent BJSM review paper is an audit of the effect female menstrual cycles have on sports injuries of all types and among all genders. (This was not a FAIR consensus review.) Injury analysis papers, the authors found, look primarily at evidence from male athletes and when they do consider female athletes’ evidence it does not account for hormonal fluctuations, despite the significant bearing that menstrual cycles have on injury occurrence. There’s a case to make that any aggregate injury analysis needs to account for cycles and their role. There’s also a case to make that cycles have enormous variation and it will take great effort to understand and account for the role of menstrual cycles in sports injury. Duty of care would suggest that there is an essential need to understand injury occurrences and prevention. If some analysis that takes shortcuts can help, those studies are valuable. But there is also an obligation to do the difficult, time-consuming work to understand the full scope of athlete injuries.\nConcussions, among all athletes, have long been a duty of care quagmire. Recall how long it took for American football to recognize its problem with concussions. Looking the other way was far easier than solving the difficult problem of football concussions when solutions meant changing fundamentals of the game, but eventually duty of care was applied and change happened. Concussion diagnosis still does not have objective criteria and relies on athletes’ self-reporting (often reluctant). Canada’s Sport Information Resource Centre took the stance that concussion symptoms reporting is a shared “duty of care” responsibility that cuts across all sports’ participants and at every level. Sports participation should not exist within a broader sports culture “that tolerates (and sometimes celebrates) pain and injury, and privileges performance over health,” the authors write. The authors are sport injury researchers at Canadian universities and they emphasize awareness and communication in their “it takes a village” solution.\nA recent meeting among Michigan high school sports administrators pointed to the considerable costs, inconsistent practices, and high stakes, the greatest of which are to athletes who are false-positives and pass their on-field cognitive evalutation. The need is for fast, accurate concussion exams in a Canada-like framework that prioritizes long-term health and well-being.\nThe legal dimension to duty of care makes it intimidating to cite duty of care in any context where there is risk of litigation. Personal injury law can be seen working at the periphery of sports to call out negligence and liability. The more important context is athletes’ health and well-being however, and duty of care should motivate the advances in sports management and coaching practice that research and technology make possible.\n\n\nInjury Reports\nHaralabob Voulgaris made tens of millions of dollars as a professional gambler on sports. Speaking with Pablo Torre on a podcast Voulgaris said that the NBA has a real integrity problem when it came to the team injury reports, especially with regard to the relationship between those reports and gambling. Voulgaris did not cite any specific example of improper or illegal activity but did describe how different teams approach the injury reports differently, with varying levels of effort and accuracy. Injury report information is crucial to serious sports gamblers who are anxious to know anything that could favor (or disfavor) their action. The team-by-team differences in report production and quality make it difficult to police public information which make it possible for insider information to leak (or spill) out in sports gambling contexts.\nThe news about injury reports is not really about the NBA though. The NCAA now requires player availability reports for the 2026 men’s and women’s Division 1 basketball tournaments. Public injury reports have been required for football in the SEC, Big Ten, ACC and Mid-American conferences. The SEC and ACC also require reports for men’s and women’s basketball, and for baseball. The NCAA pointed out that the reports keep gambling interests from interacting directly with student-athletes about their health status.\nA medical school student and two professors wrote an opinion essay in the medical news outlet STAT, saying that the personal information contained in team injury reports would constitute a serious privacy violation if they had not been subject to collective bargaining and contractual language between the athletes and their leagues. The origin of injury reports dates to 1947 when the NFL commission learned of dramatic shifts in betting leading up to a game where a flu had significantly compromised one team. The authors, two Yale doctors and a Case Western lawyer, say that it’s enough to say that an athlete will not compete, and any potentially invasive details are not necessary. As NCAA athletes become more subject to injury reporting requirements there is no indication who or how anyone will defend their privacy interests in the disclosures."
