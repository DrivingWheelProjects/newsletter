    "title": "ADCN: A sports science and technology newsletter by Brad Stenger",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to my resurrected sports science and technology newsletter. I've given it a title, the \"Athletes Data Community Newsletter,\" something that reflects my research interests.\nI'm going into my last year of a Computer Science PhD at the University of Vermont and my primary research projects focus on privacy aspects of athletes’ health and performance data. Other papers in preparation: task analysis for athletes' data technologies based on field-based research, athletes' injury risk from an engineering systems perspective, socio-technical impediments and solutions for data sharing in sports. By putting athletes' data front and center I think that it will be possible to discuss the varied aspects of how data gets collected, managed and applied across the full spectrum of sports. At least I hope so.\n\nConcussions in 2025\nflashing smart mouthguards and the growing importance of injury risk awareness\nFootball season is concussion season, according to CNN. Fortunately research in traumatic brain injury continues to advance. A U.S. research team led by a Milwaukee team from St. Luke's Medical Center and Medical College of Wisconsin observed that 75% of football players experienced fewer head impact exposure after return to play. Longer post-concussion recovery led to larger decreases in head impact exposures. Conservative return-to-play management from concussion likely increases athletes' awareness of head impacts and improves their ability to protect themselves.\nAwareness is central to a smart impact-sensing mouthguard with a bright red light that flashes above threshold acceleration values (75g for men, 65g for women, or 4500 radians per second squared). Years ago, research biomedical engineer Eric Nauman (then at Purdue, now at University of Cincinnati) told me that football helmets should have plastic shells that would crack at similar thresholds, and prompt the same response: Get that athlete off the field. The evidence is the urgency, and without both, the decision-making circumstance changes.\nAn athlete, a coach or a referee can all choose to play on without a clear and obivious signal that it is irresponsible to continue. \"Where athletes really get themselves into trouble – they continue to play. They get another, even minor, hit, and the symptoms get even more amplified,\" says Marie Schaefer of Cleveland Clinic. Technology that improves injury risk awareness and accounting is potentially disruptive, but only if norms in sport prioritize risk awareness. The alternative is to attribute sports injury to bad luck and believe that athletes inevitably get hurt.\n\n\nSynthetic Data in Sports\nsynthetic data is important technology for sports at the junction of data science, data sharing and privacy\nPrivacy and data sharing in sports, this is my research in the PhD program at the University of Vermont. Questions about privacy for athletes' health and performance data have largely been unasked, and unanswered. So I am trying to ask them. Expect to see lots more about these subjects in the weeks ahead.\nSynthetic data, it turns out, is a crucial aspect of my research. Synthetic data, data that is produced algorithmically as opposed to being observed or collected, is capable of guaranteeing both privacy and quality and lends itself to widespread sharing. Examples of sports-related synthetic data are just proof of concept at this point. A study out of Ireland uses synthetic data to predict gait stability in an older population. The context is more sports-adjacent than actual sports but the work is a stepping stone to more complex biomechanical movements and more diverse athletic populations. Earlier this summer John Warmenhoven derived a synthetic dataset that showed only numerical acute training load, numerical chronic training load (4-week) and a binary injury data point, all expressed on a per week basis. The paper is a simple how-to and little more, \"an important first step toward better understanding of the utility of synthetic data for the sports and exercise sciences more broadly,\" the authors write.\n\n\nHidden Danger of Gambling\nathletes' performance data is essential information for sports gamblers who seek to create a betting edge based on predictions of players' health, performance and injury\nA lawsuit is working its way through UK courts. A group of Premier League players has sued via \"stop processing\" requests in order to rein in the access that commercial operators have to player performance data. Commercial operators consist of broadcasters, game developers and gambling companies, and they have negotiated data access rights with sports leagues under collective bargaining positions that those leagues have established with its players. Information fuels the analysis of high stakes sports gambling, and no one has higher stakes that the firms that take sports bets. Profiting from sports gambling depends on maintaining an edge that can tilt odds in ways that other bettors cannot expect. The amount of player performance data that is needed to create an edge is substantial, making it somewhat unrealistic at present. The payoff that will come from developing the edge is substantial however.\nHenry Abbott makes the point in a researched essay that team-wide health and stamina are deciding NBA games, displacing some of the importance that star-level talent has in teams' game models.\nLonger-term, performance data has a significant role to play in the personalized care and training that elite athletes increasingly require, according to the Danish authors of Consensus Statement-Optimizing Performance of the Elite Athlete, recently published in the Scandanavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports. The authors write, “Technological innovations are likely to enable the development of personalized training and nutrition strategies in the next decades through emerging technologies. … These innovations may allow for better tailoring of training and nutrition strategies across the varying demands of training and competition.\nAs the personalization advances, analysis of athletes' data should also provide clearer pictures for injury prevention and injury prediction. Nothing about the future of sports scares me more than sports gamblers inventing and then using an edge based on athlete injury prediction."

    "title": "ADCN: Women Athletes Research, Sports Injury Epidemiology, Hot Hands in Big Jobs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s a lengthy rundown on women athletes’ health and performance research. The news peg for it is the announcement of a new University of Indiana initiative, which gave me a chance to look at the bigger picture. Short answer, it’s in a much better place than it was in five or ten years ago. And there is a good chance that it could snowball, as the research raises more questions and technology advances new ways to answer those questions. You, the readers, can expect overviews like this as opportunities to come up to speed on crucial subjects materialize. I thank you for your attention.\n\nIndiana University Female Sports Performance and Research Initiative\nand a rundown of women athletes research\nIndiana University recently announced a women athletes research initiative in partnership with Indiana Sports Corp and Pacers Sports & Entertainment. No dollar or grant-specific information was forthcoming but the program’s research committee co-chair, Katie Siek, is a revealing choice. Siek is professor of informatics and a human- and health-centered computer scientist. (The other co-chair of the research committee is Avinash Chandran, whose work is also discussed in this newsletter.) “Our whole goal here is to actually collect that data and help create interactive systems so that athletes can get better information to improve their health, and the health care system can better provide support for them,” Siek told the Indianapolis Record news organization.\nSports research has been gaining currency in the computing research community that focuses on human-centered computing and human-computer interaction. After a major conference workshop in 2024 sports researchers in the community published Grand Challenges in SportsHCI which stated that “we believe in the benefit of generating fundamental knowledge for SportsHCI more broadly to advance the field as a whole. To achieve this, we aim to identify the grand challenges in SportsHCI, which can help researchers and practitioners in developing a future research agenda.” University of Florida researchers published follow-up work last spring, Coach, Data Analyst, and Protector: Exploring Data Practices of Collegiate Coaching Staff that enlisted coaches for focus groups and found that “coaching staff selectively use data with the goal of balancing performance goals, athlete emotional well-being, and privacy.” Siek has studied prototypes of DaVinci Wearables’ technology that tracks female athlete physiology through biometrics (body temperature, galvanic skin response, body composition, cycle tracking) and assists athletes in reaching performance goals.\nA sports research initiative based on computing is a new kind of interdisciplinary hub for this work. The Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance based primarily at Stanford University is broadly based in medical and life science. The University of Michigan Human Performance & Sport Science Center resides in the School of Kinesiology. The FIFA Women’s Football Development Programme takes a soccer-centric approach. The International Olympic Committee has created the Female, woman, and girl Athlete Injury pRevention (FAIR) consensus.\nPapers, conferences and spinouts are a good indicator for when a research initiative has hit critical mass and has impact. The FIFA Women’s group has a set of papers, many attempting to define benchmarks for elite women athletes, covering injury events and recovery parameters (links). The FAIR consensus has also produced a series of expert reviews on gender affects and prevention strategies for sport-related injury. The group also recently held the Female, Woman, and Girl Athlete Health and Safety Summit at the University of Calgary. The sixth editon of the Female Athlete Conference took place last spring in Boston and conference founder Kate Ackerman is the director of the new Women’s Health, Sports & Performance Institute, a translational sports medicine research center outside Boston. Stanford and Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance will host its inaugural Female Athlete Research Meeting (FARM) in November.\n\n\nBayesian Injury Rate Estimation\na shift is underway from “frequentist” to “Bayesian” injury surveillance analysis\nA couple of recent papers by Avinash Chandran announce a shift in the way that the NCAA does injury surveillance. Chandran describes the change as moving from a “frequentist” approach to a Bayesian approach in two papers: The Practical Value of Bayesian Inference in Describing the Epidemiology of Sports Injuries from Sports Medicine journal, and Bayesian methods for estimating injury rates in sport injury epidemiology from Injury Epidemiology journal. Chandran is the injury epidemiologist in charge of the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program for the Datalys Center, a non-profit collaborative research organization originally founded by the NCAA and the American College of Sports Medicine.\nThe difference between frequentist and Bayesian is almost as stark as analysis before and after the emergence of data science. Frequentist approaches center on counts and the traditional practice of statistical hypothesis tests, statistical significance and p-values. Bayesian approaches, in general, can take any and all prior information and then use that information to calculate posterior probabilities for the likelihood of statistical events. The frequentist approach is what it is, while the Bayesian approach iterates and evolves as meaningful prior information is applied. The change is a crucial progress step for injury surveillance and, potentially, for the NCAA.\nWhy you ask? Injury surveillance has its benchmark measurement, called injury rate, which in frequentist terms is the number of injury occurrences divided by the number of injury exposures. Chandran’s workflow for an injury rate Bayesian model looks like this. \nNew information that will improve injury rate calculation are coming. Biometric, biomechanical and biomarker information now present a more in-depth picture of athletes’ ongoing physiology along with essential recovery and fatigue details. The rate-limiting step probably is not going to be the lag in completing the studies to merge the new information. More likely the greater lag will come from organizing the athletes’ data into coherent pathways for causal analysis of athletes’ injuries that can make the sum of all the investigations greater than its parts. The NCAA and its Sports Science Institute could champion the effort, and so could the federal government if it decides to play a role in managing college sports. Professional sports leagues could also provide a guiding hand, and as a result become a major beneficiary of the research.\n\n\nHot Hand and Talent Evaluation\nextending the Hot Hand Fallacy to front office decision-making\nThe hot-hand fallacy has been a talking point since Amos Tversky and colleagues first identified the hot-hand in the 1980s.\nThe idea is simple. Recent success increases the likelihood of future success. The classic case, the one Tversky identified, is the basketball player who makes a few shots in a row, prompting both the player and teammates to expect the next shot to go in as well. The premise has been rebutted and amended by psychologists, economists and statisticians seeking ground truth for what is more accurately called a heuristic. That heuristic is often (but not always) a source of bad decisions and bad outcomes. A couple of recent articles prompted me to ask if the front office decision-making is as prone to hot-handedness as the players on the court, ice, pitch or field.\n“The relationship between cash and winning in the NFL is complicated,” Mike Sando writes at the start of his September 12 article at The Athletic, Ranking NFL teams by spending: The boldest, most frugal and best bang for the buck. Front offices make personnel decisions with varying degrees of confidence and uncertainty. No organization gets every transaction right. But string together personnel wins, whether by draft, trade or free agency and it shows up as wins on the field. To believe that an organization’s decision process is more sound than lucky is to play the hot hand. When that happens the team-wide regression to the mean is imminent.\nSome singular moves can turn out bo be force multipliers according to Sando’s analysis. The Chiefs pay less than market value for an All-World quarterback. The Rams have a superior coach known to do more with less. Some teams have a philosophy that raises their floor. The Eagles always choose to spend money on talent when given the opportunity. The Steelers spend lots more on defense than on offense.\n“When one contention window closes, another one opens,” Dom Luszczyszyn and Scott Wheeler write at the start of their September 17 article, also at The Athletic, The NHL Contention Cycle: Where does each team stand going into 2025-26 and in the future? Like the NFL, teams are all over the place with some rising and others falling. The regression to the mean among NHL hockey teams is maybe more random, and therefore more unavoidable, than NFL football teams if you agree that title contention is cyclical.\nLiverpool has held on to its elite position in the Premiere League despite significant squad turnover. This last article, originally from OneFootball’s Anfield Index blog, describes how the team’s sports science and medical department play a crucial role in talent evaluation. The athletes’ health and performance information was part of the team’s big-money decisions to extend Mohammad Sala’s contract (despite his advanced age) and to acquire Alexander Isak (despite his injury concerns). Another article, again by The Athletic, provides an in-depth analysis of Liverpool’s summer transfer ins and outs. Hidden in the details is how Will Spearman, director of research, championed the signing of Hugo Ekitike, comparing his age-grade statistics to Haaland and Mbappe. If there is an overarching philosophy, Liverpool shows a strong desire to stay young, “Every player Liverpool signed, with the exception of backup goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, is aged 25 or under.” Has the squad’s front office operators raised the team’s floor, or is the inevitable regression to the mean coming? Liverpool’s season is off to a fantastic start but it’s a long season ahead."

The cause was a contagious gastroenteritis that came with U.S. swimmers from their training camp in Thailand.

Leagues, teams and athletes will probably want to anticipate worst case scenarios, COVID-level precautions, in order to assure athlete health when there is regional, national or international travel for competition, whether that is for games or tournaments or Olympics or World Cups. The potential exposure combined with the high stakes for athletes’ health and performance makes it almost necessary to institute bubble-like preventive measures in order to make it more likely to identify contagious infections sooner and not later. And as public health infrastructure degrades the need increases to step up bubble-type precautions. For example, personal health-monitoring measurements using wearables &lt;a href=\\\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01593-2\\\"&gt;has been shown&lt;/a&gt; to identify infections before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;\"},{\"p\":\"&lt;p&gt;How bad will public health get?

    "text": "As I get the newsletter up and running it might take a few weeks to work out a regular production schedule. My goal is to have a regular once per week delivery by Thanksgiving, and then ramp up to twice per week by year end. The amount of available material is substantial, and that is exciting. Eventually, and probably soon, I should have a succinct description for what this newsletter covers and why. The voice will be technically dense, culturally relevant and fun to read. There will also be a website spinning up at https://newsletter.bradstenger.com as the newsletter comes together. I am using the Quarto publishing system and I am excited about the possibilities that the platform offers.\n\nSports, Infectious Disease and Public Health Policy\na smaller CDC puts athletes at risk\nThe number of compromised athletes from illness far exceeded the number of compromised athletes from injury at the most recent Swimming World Championships in Singapore. The cause was a contagious gastroenteritis that came with U.S. swimmers from their training camp in Thailand. Elite athletes normally use 5-star facilities, and before COVID they could normally count on an environment that would not make them sick. COVID changed the rules, and no place, no matter the expense, could assure total confidence.\nConfidence in public health is about to get worse as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shrinks in size and responsibility. Leagues, teams and athletes will probably want to anticipate worst case scenarios, COVID-level precautions, in order to assure athlete health when there is regional, national or international travel for competition, whether that is for games or tournaments or Olympics or World Cups. The potential exposure combined with the high stakes for athletes’ health and performance makes it almost necessary to institute bubble-like preventive measures in order to make it more likely to identify contagious infections sooner and not later. And as public health infrastructure degrades the need increases to step up bubble-type precautions. For example, personal health-monitoring measurements using wearables has been shown to identify infections before symptoms appear.\nHow bad will public health get? It looks like that depends on where you go. Vermont, where I am, looks like it will establish public health monitoring in an alliance with the other New England states. California, Oregon and Washington plan something similar on the West coast. Properly-funded government public infrastructure has an important role in developing monitoring technologies. The wastewater monitoring that helped to corral COVID is set to improve as AI and functional genomics describe real-time risk inherent to changes that occur with mutating pathogenic vectors. Eventually the tech will make it possible to where and why infectious disease risk is high. But that’s not the world we have right now.\n\n\nPersonalized Nutrition\nnutrition is an n=1 experiment\nMore than 80% of student-athletes at the University of Georgia eat at Chipotle at least once per week. The figure is 98% for Ohio State student-athletes. The statistics are part of the announcement that Chipotle now gives student-athletes at Georgia, Ohio State and University of Florida (&gt; 90%) coupons for free food during their sports seasons.\nThere’s a trend among food product developers to target demand among active populations with new offerings. Supplements like creatine, protein and collagen have shown increased effectiveness in active populations where inactive populations do not benefit, coming from Mike Ormsbee in his conversation with podcaster (and restauranteur) David Chang. The same should be true for substantial, relatively unprocessed fast casual burrito bowls.\nUltra-endurance athletes have begun to seize competitive advantages from fueling strategies that make sure energy stores are not depleted. The nutrition programs have become personalized and precise. Continued progress to personalized nutrition will accelerate as the research continues. There’s a good chance that future will look something like Chipotle where my order (burrito: 2x chicken, pinto beans, cheese and lettuce) is what works for me and not necessarily anyone else. The minimally processed, substantial mix of quality proteins and carbohydrates hits at the lowest common denominator of what an athlete needs but there is no single recipe that works for all athletes.\nThe question of how to eat becomes more important than what to eat if it becomes incumbent for each athlete to be their own personalized nutrition expert. A recent Stanford study shows that blood sugar responses to carbohydrate intake is highly variable, and depends on individual health and metabolism. But where subtypes for general pre-diabetic populations can be measured, each and every high-performance athlete might be their own singular subtype.\n\n\nPredicting Athletes’ (Re)Injuries\nexpect regular info on how algorithms and models for injury continue to evolve\nNew research out of Australia took data from one Australian Football League club to model athletes’ re-injury susceptability. The study takes athlete data for 1 season and 1 team, combining injury data for 33 athletes with performance tracking data 2500+ training and competition sessions. The injury prediction model comes from ~100 injuries, meaning that very few sessions had injuries occur, pointing to the obvious benefit from data sharing among teams in order to base results on data with more injuries and more data sets.\nThe work combines survival modeling and a Hidden Markov Model, an approach that tracks a range of known covariates and also incorporates hidden, unknown or unknowable factors but still provides measurable reliability for predictions. Age, it turns out, is the leading covariate factor affecting re-injury. But \"factors relating to the number of efforts exceeding 95%ile in terms of speed, perceived exertion and acceleration had significant affects on risk of re-injury.\"\nThe results are somewhat consistent with a 5000-person study of injured runners that gained attention this summer. Danish researchers used Garmin data for recreational runners and identified 1820 injured athletes. Large spikes in training distances were the most frequent cause of overuse injuries which authors found to occur in 30% of runners who had at least 200 running sessions.\nIn both the elite athlete who is recovering from injury, or the recreational athlete who trains irregularly, it is essential to prepare for maximum effort endeavors."
