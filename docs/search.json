    "text": "Welcome to my resurrected sports science and technology newsletter. I've given it a title, the \"Athletes Data Community Newsletter,\" something that reflects my research interests.\nI'm going into my last year of a Computer Science PhD at the University of Vermont and my primary research projects focus on privacy aspects of athletes’ health and performance data. Other papers in preparation: task analysis for athletes' data technologies based on field-based research, athletes' injury risk from an engineering systems perspective, socio-technical impediments and solutions for data sharing in sports. By putting athletes' data front and center I think that it will be possible to discuss the varied aspects of how data gets collected, managed and applied across the full spectrum of sports. At least I hope so.\n\nConcussions in 2025\nflashing smart mouthguards and the growing importance of injury risk awareness\nFootball season is concussion season, according to CNN. Fortunately research in traumatic brain injury continues to advance. A U.S. research team led by a Milwaukee team from St. Luke's Medical Center and Medical College of Wisconsin observed that 75% of football players experienced fewer head impact exposure after return to play. Longer post-concussion recovery led to larger decreases in head impact exposures. Conservative return-to-play management from concussion likely increases athletes' awareness of head impacts and improves their ability to protect themselves.\nAwareness is central to a smart impact-sensing mouthguard with a bright red light that flashes above threshold acceleration values (75g for men, 65g for women, or 4500 radians per second squared). Years ago, research biomedical engineer Eric Nauman (then at Purdue, now at University of Cincinnati) told me that football helmets should have plastic shells that would crack at similar thresholds, and prompt the same response: Get that athlete off the field. The evidence is the urgency, and without both, the decision-making circumstance changes.\nAn athlete, a coach or a referee can all choose to play on without a clear and obivious signal that it is irresponsible to continue. \"Where athletes really get themselves into trouble – they continue to play. They get another, even minor, hit, and the symptoms get even more amplified,\" says Marie Schaefer of Cleveland Clinic. Technology that improves injury risk awareness and accounting is potentially disruptive, but only if norms in sport prioritize risk awareness. The alternative is to attribute sports injury to bad luck and believe that athletes inevitably get hurt.\n\n\nSynthetic Data in Sports\nsynthetic data is important technology for sports at the junction of data science, data sharing and privacy\nPrivacy and data sharing in sports, this is my research in the PhD program at the University of Vermont. Questions about privacy for athletes' health and performance data have largely been unasked, and unanswered. So I am trying to ask them. Expect to see lots more about these subjects in the weeks ahead.\nSynthetic data, it turns out, is a crucial aspect of my research. Synthetic data, data that is produced algorithmically as opposed to being observed or collected, is capable of guaranteeing both privacy and quality and lends itself to widespread sharing. Examples of sports-related synthetic data are just proof of concept at this point. A study out of Ireland uses synthetic data to predict gait stability in an older population. The context is more sports-adjacent than actual sports but the work is a stepping stone to more complex biomechanical movements and more diverse athletic populations. Earlier this summer John Warmenhoven derived a synthetic dataset that showed only numerical acute training load, numerical chronic training load (4-week) and a binary injury data point, all expressed on a per week basis. The paper is a simple how-to and little more, \"an important first step toward better understanding of the utility of synthetic data for the sports and exercise sciences more broadly,\" the authors write.\n\n\nHidden Danger of Gambling\nathletes' performance data is essential information for sports gamblers who seek to create a betting edge based on predictions of players' health, performance and injury\nA lawsuit is working its way through UK courts. A group of Premier League players has sued via \"stop processing\" requests in order to rein in the access that commercial operators have to player performance data. Commercial operators consist of broadcasters, game developers and gambling companies, and they have negotiated data access rights with sports leagues under collective bargaining positions that those leagues have established with its players. Information fuels the analysis of high stakes sports gambling, and no one has higher stakes that the firms that take sports bets. Profiting from sports gambling depends on maintaining an edge that can tilt odds in ways that other bettors cannot expect. The amount of player performance data that is needed to create an edge is substantial, making it somewhat unrealistic at present. The payoff that will come from developing the edge is substantial however.\nHenry Abbott makes the point in a researched essay that team-wide health and stamina are deciding NBA games, displacing some of the importance that star-level talent has in teams' game models.\nLonger-term, performance data has a significant role to play in the personalized care and training that elite athletes increasingly require, according to the Danish authors of Consensus Statement-Optimizing Performance of the Elite Athlete, recently published in the Scandanavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports. The authors write, “Technological innovations are likely to enable the development of personalized training and nutrition strategies in the next decades through emerging technologies. … These innovations may allow for better tailoring of training and nutrition strategies across the varying demands of training and competition.\nAs the personalization advances, analysis of athletes' data should also provide clearer pictures for injury prevention and injury prediction. Nothing about the future of sports scares me more than sports gamblers inventing and then using an edge based on athlete injury prediction."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As I get the newsletter up and running it might take a few weeks to work out a regular production schedule. My goal is to have a regular once per week delivery by Thanksgiving, and then ramp up to twice per week by year end. The amount of available material is substantial, and that is exciting. Eventually, and probably soon, I should have a succinct description for what this newsletter covers and why. The voice will be technically dense, culturally relevant and fun to read. There will also be a website spinning up at https://newsletter.bradstenger.com as the newsletter comes together. I am using the Quarto publishing system and I am excited about the possibilities that the platform offers.\n\nSports, Infectious Disease and Public Health Policy\na smaller CDC puts athletes at risk\nThe number of compromised athletes from illness far exceeded the number of compromised athletes from injury at the most recent Swimming World Championships in Singapore. The cause was a contagious gastroenteritis that came with U.S. swimmers from their training camp in Thailand. Elite athletes normally use 5-star facilities, and before COVID they could normally count on an environment that would not make them sick. COVID changed the rules, and no place, no matter the expense, could assure total confidence.\nConfidence in public health is about to get worse as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shrinks in size and responsibility. Leagues, teams and athletes will probably want to anticipate worst case scenarios, COVID-level precautions, in order to assure athlete health when there is regional, national or international travel for competition, whether that is for games or tournaments or Olympics or World Cups. The potential exposure combined with the high stakes for athletes’ health and performance makes it almost necessary to institute bubble-like preventive measures in order to make it more likely to catch contagious infections sooner and not later. And as public health infrastructure degrades the need increases to step up bubble-type precautions. For example, monitoring heart-rate variability using wearables has been shown to identify infections before symptoms appear.\nHow bad will public health get? It looks like that depends on where you go. Vermont, where I am, looks like it will establish public health monitoring in an alliance with the other New England states. California, Oregon and Washington plan something similar on the West coast. Properly-funded government public infrastructure has an important role in developing monitoring technologies. The wastewater monitoring that helped to corral COVID is set to improve as AI and functional genomics describe real-time risk inherent to changes that occur with mutating pathogenic vectors. Eventually the tech will make it possible to where and why infectious disease risk is high. But that’s not the world we have right now.\n\n\nPersonalized Nutrition\nnuttrition is an n=1 experiment\nMore than 80% of student-athletes at the University of Georgia eat at Chipotle at least once per week. The figure is 98% for Ohio State student-athletes. The statistics are part of the announcement that Chipotle now gives student-athletes at Georgia, Ohio State and University of Florida (&gt; 90%) coupons for free food during their sports seasons.\nThere’s a trend among food product developers to target demand among active populations with new offerings. Supplements like creatine, protein and collagen have shown increased effectiveness in active populations where inactive populations do not benefit, coming from Mike Ormsbee in his conversation with podcaster (and restauranteur) David Chang. The same should be true for substantial, relatively unprocessed fast casual burrito bowls.\nUltra-endurance athletes have begun to seize competitive advantages from fueling strategies that make sure energy stores are not depleted. The nutrition programs have become personalized and precise. Continued progress to personalized nutrition will accelerate as the research continues. There’s a good chance that future will look something like Chipotle where my order (burrito: 2x chicken, pinto beans, cheese and lettuce) is what works for me and not necessarily anyone else. The minimally processed, substantial mix of quality proteins and carbohydrates hits at the lowest common denominator of what an athlete needs but there is no single recipe that works for all athletes.\nThe question of how to eat becomes more important than what to eat if it becomes incumbent for each athlete to be their own personalized nutrition expert. A recent Stanford study shows that blood sugar responses to carbohydrate intake is highly variable, and depends on individual health and metabolism. But where subtypes for general pre-diabetic populations can be measured, each and every high-performance athlete might be their own singular subtype.\n\n\nPredicting Athletes’ (Re)Injuries\nexpect regular info on how algorithms and models for injury continue to evolve\nNew research out of Australia took data from one Australian Football League club to model athletes’ re-injury susceptability. The study takes athlete data for 1 season and 1 team, combining injury data for 33 athletes with performance tracking data 2500+ training and competition sessions. The injury prediction model comes from ~100 injuries, meaning that very few sessions had injuries occur, pointing to the obvious benefit from data sharing among teams in order to base results on data with more injuries and more data sets.\nThe work combines survival modelling and a Hidden Markov Model, an approach that tracks a range of known covariates and also incorporates hidden, unknown or unknowable factors but still provides measurable reliability for predictions. Age, it turns out, is the leading covariate factor affecting re-injury. But \"factors relating to the number of efforts exceeding 95%ile in terms of speed, perceived exertion and acceleration had significant affects on risk of re-injury.\"\nThe results are somewhat consistent with a 5000-person study of injured runners that gained attention this summer. Danish researchers used Garmin data for recreational runners and identified 1820 injured athletes. Large spikes in training distances were the most frequent cause of overuse injuries which authors found to occur in 30% of runners who had at least 200 running sessions.\nIn both the elite athlete who is recovering from injury, or the recreational athlete who trains irregularly, it is essential to prepare for maximum effort endeavors."
